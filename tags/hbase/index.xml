      <description>Background In order to manage the health of populations, Cerner builds data-driven solutions built on top of its HealtheIntentâ„  platform. The platform transforms and standardizes data across disparate health systems. The data is then used in algorithms that aid healthcare providers and hospitals in managing and monitoring health both at a person and population level.
The Reference Record is one of the core components of the HealtheIntent platform. It represents the data known about a person&amp;rsquo;s health from a particular source of healthcare information.</description>
