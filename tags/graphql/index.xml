      <description>In June, we had the pleasure of having Mat Warger join us in our Tech Talk series at Oracle Cerner. Mat is a senior software developer based in Kansas City. He enjoys learning new concepts and has leveraged this curiosity in positions ranging from startups to the enterprise over the past decade. He is a co-organizer of the JavaScript KC meetup group and organizer of GraphQL KC meetup group. He can be found chasing the latest and (sometimes) greatest in a wide range of languages and platforms, including React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and the cloud.</description>
