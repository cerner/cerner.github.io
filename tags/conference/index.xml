      <description>In 2010 a group of Cerner engineers went to their leadership with an idea: a Cerner tech conference just for the internal development community, built and run from the ground up.

It was seen as an opportunity to create a large scale, sharing and learning experience for associates in Cerner&amp;rsquo;s technical workforces.
From the beginning, buy-in from leadership was essential for the conference to succeed.</description>
