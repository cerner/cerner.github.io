      <description>At Cerner, we manage our own infrastructure and a big part of that is managing F5 load balancers. If you are a Ruby developer or a network engineer and regularly work with F5s, then I have good news! I&amp;rsquo;ve created a gem that abstracts iControl&amp;rsquo;s REST API. It makes working with the API easy to understand and eases the effort required to automate changes across many devices.
