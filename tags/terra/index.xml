      <description>Since 2017, we at Cerner have been building Terra, a single page web application framework, and accessibility has always been a primary goal. Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about how to build and test accessible websites, as well as the diverse group of people we&amp;rsquo;re serving. With this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;d like to take a moment to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far.
Why accessibility matters At Cerner, we build software for many different users in many different roles.</description>
