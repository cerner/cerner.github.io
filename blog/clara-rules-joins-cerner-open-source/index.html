                            <p>Sometimes a small experiment on the side can grow into something valuable. We at Cerner have long
used forward-chaining rules engines to express and execute clinical knowledge, but we’ve also had to
extend or work around the capabilities of such engines. Engines targeting business users just
weren’t expressive enough to model some of our logic. To meet this need we are making Clara Rules an
open source project driven by Cerner Engineering.</p>
<p>Clara took an unusual path, starting as a minimal implementation of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm">Rete algorithm</a> to help my
own understanding. After sharing this with others at Cerner, we started to see an opportunity to
gain the modularity and reasoning advantages of a rules engine, while preserving the expressiveness
and power of a modern programming language. We wanted to combine the best ideas of rules engines
with good software engineering practices. You can see the result of this on the
<a href="http://www.clara-rules.org">Clara Rules home page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mrrodriguez">Mike Rodriguez</a> has been essential in turning Clara from an
experiment into a valuable system to fill a gap for rules engines which are oriented towards
developers. More recently, <a href="https://github.com/WilliamParker">Will Parker</a>
has also made significant contributions to help make Clara fast and reliable. They made it possible for Clara
to help analyze millions of medical records every day. Therefore Mike and Will are joining as the
initial committers to Cerner Engineering’s Clara project. We will welcome other contributors to make
this step in the future.</p>
<p>You can find project <a href="https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules">source code on GitHub</a>, and the
documentation on the <a href="http://www.clara-rules.org">clara-rules.org</a> site.</p>

                Another ShipIt Day was held on September 8th-9th at the Realization Campus at Cerner. ShipIt is a 24-hour hackathon with the goal of building something awesome, usable, and value-adding within a single day. This fall marked our sixth ShipIt, which has has grown significantly since our first event.
   The event kicked off in the morning at the auditorium of our Realization campus. At this point, teams were already formed, instructions were given, and shirts were handed out.

                At Cerner, we love Ruby and Rails and use it prominently in our cloud based solutions. When we found out RailsConf 2016 was going to be held in the hometown of Cerner’s headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, we were excited for the opportunity to support the conference by attending as well as being a sponsor and hosting one of the official after parties.
   RailsConf 2016 took place in the heart of downtown Kansas City.

                ShipIt Day is an all day, all night hackathon with the goal of building something awesome, usable, and value-adding within the given 24 hours. This Spring marked our fifth ShipIt Day, with participation and reach growing with each event.
We kicked off the event at 10 AM on Thursday, when teams broke out and got to work and stopped only for food and caffeine. Many stayed until a few hours after dinner arrived, several stayed all night and took naps in their workspace, and a few worked through the whole night.
