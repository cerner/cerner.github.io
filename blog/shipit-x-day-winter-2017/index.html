<p>This was our third ShipIt Day hosted at our new Innovations campus. It continues to be a great location for ShipIt because of our awesome game rooms and collaboration spaces. As part of this ShipIt, we had a sponsored theme, which focused on building React applications using <a href="https://github.com/cerner/kaiju">Kaiju</a> that are based on Cerner&rsquo;s consistent <a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/">Terra UI</a> theme. Team members that support these projects were available to help participants if they wished to use these technologies, helping to gain more feedback on the projects, and to expand the exposure of these projects to ShipIt teams. By including this theme, we also introduced a new category for someone to win by using these projects.</p>

<p>Demos always arrive quicker than anticipated. Ready or not, 9am rolled around and demos were in full swing. Teams got 4 minutes to present their projects to a panel of judges, consisting of Michelle Brush, Robert Farr, Tim Erdel, Chad Moats, and Chuck Schneider.  Special thank you to those folks for spending their morning with us and supporting ShipIt Day!</p>

</div>
<p>Coming in first place was Team Delayed Gratification (Russ Star, Ben Hemphill, Morgan Patterson).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ShipIt team, Delayed Gratification, worked to complete  an existing side project called the &ldquo;RUSS test,&rdquo; aka Really Useful Speed Service. The goal is to allow service owners to make smart decisions about where to  geographically place their services by providing response time, bandwidth, and other key network metrics.</p>

<p>Congratulations Team Delayed Gratification! A much deserved win.</p>

</div>
<p>Second place went to Team ShipIt X Files (Santosh Manughala, Carlos Salazar, Matt Horn, Seada Ali).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our project was to create an application for discovering related database rows that let&rsquo;s the user quickly navigate back-end data in Millennium, (e.g. look up lots of useful info for a given personnel id, person id, or event id). Each bit of data could be clickable to do a new search on that id (search the person you found on a clinical event in one click). The app displays information so that it is easy to navigate.</p>

<p>Way to go, Team ShipIT X Files!</p>

</div>
<p>Team A Near Field Far Far Away (Aurko Ghosh, Aaron Kaplan, Vijay Ayilavarapu, Nikhil Agrawal, Neil Pathare) took third place. Their project utilized our MakerSpace!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For ShipIt, we assembled a 3D printed light bridge that provides 180% of bright light for the soldering workbench. In addition to assembly, we designed and attempted to implement an RGB LED controller using a Raspberry Pi 3 and mosfet chips. The controller uses both a physical switch, as well as a mobile app to control the lighting. The mobile app is developed using React Native, and communicates wirelessly with the controller via Near Field Communication (NFC).</p>

<p>Judge Chuck Schneider noted, &ldquo;I like that they took on a lot of different pieces, which adds to the complexity of the project.&rdquo;</p>

        </a>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>The winners of the sponsored project theme was a veteran team, Flying Mongoose (Mahesh Acharya, Taylor Clay, Cihan Kaynak, Matt Stramel). They were able to start the migration of <a href="https://www.cerner.com/solutions/automated-dispensing-cabinet">Cerner&rsquo;s RxStation</a> to a React application utilizing Terra UI. They were able to utilize Kaiju to build the prototype UI, which had dynamically loaded tables and mock buttons. By using ShipIt to start this transition, they were able to learn a lot of what it would take to make these next steps.</p>
<p>Nicely done Team Flying Mongoose!</p>

<p>Each ShipIt Day, the projects get more intricate and more creative. The projects presented show off the talent we have. After surveying the participants on their projects, 45% of the projects were identified to improve daily work at Cerner. ShipIt Day remains one of our most popular dev culture events at Cerner.</p>
<p>First time participant, Ted Segal said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a new developer, I&rsquo;m still in the <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devacademy/">DevAcademy</a>, and I really appreciated the chance to learn about tools and ideas that I had not been exposed to yet from more experienced developers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veteran participant, Alex Harder said he likes participating in ShipIt Day because he enjoys exploring new technologies and applying them to a problem. ShipIt Day continues to be successful among Cerner associates. Whether you want to work on something you don’t normally have time to, or you’re interested in meeting new people, ShipIt Day is a winner!</p>
<p>Save the Date: ShipIt Day returns March 8th and 9th! If you are interested in learning more about other ShipIt Days, see these earlier posts:</p>

                There is no better way to end summer than with ShipIt Day! We kicked off our ninth ShipIt Day on August 10th, with more than 75 Cerner associates signed up. Nineteen different teams worked for 24 hours straight to complete their projects. For those unfamiliar with the event, ShipIt Day is a 24 hour hackathon for internal associates to create something innovative, usable, and value-adding. This was the second ShipIt held at our new Innovations Campus.

                ShipIt Day VIII was held on April 20 and 21st. Seventeen teams made up of internal associates had just 24 hours to create something innovative, usable, and value-adding. This quarter’s ShipIt Day was held at our new Innovations Campus in the Link Conference Center. We were excited to get to utilize the space for this event. Another awesome addition to this quarter’s ShipIt Day was our new game rooms.

                Cerner’s 7th ShipIt Day took place on December 8th and 9th. ShipIt is a 24-hour hackathon with the goal of building something awesome, usable, and value-adding within a single day. The event was hosted at our DevCenter in the Realization Campus, a large open space that hosts our DevAcademy (to learn more about our DevAcademy, check out this earlier post). We had 18 teams made up of associates from different Cerner organizations.
