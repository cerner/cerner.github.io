                            <p>This past June, 2,500 associates from across Cerner came together for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0YoFg-hkE">DevCon</a>, our internal developers conference. Now in its 3rd year, DevCon is a two-day, engineering-led conference that was created to bring together Cerner associates involved in all aspects of development and technology. DevCon is organized and run like many other developer conferences, complete with a call for papers and a talk selection committee. This year, we had 80 talks covering a wide array of topics such as big data, user experience and design, DevOps, and mobile development.</p>
<p>A keynote presentation kicks off each day followed by talks across multiple tracks. <a href="https://twitter.com/skeptomai">Chris Brown</a>, CTO of <a href="http://www.opscode.com/">Opscode</a>, the creators of the open-source <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home">Chef Platform</a>, kicked off DevCon this year with a talk on the emergence and importance of DevOps. Within engineering at Cerner, embracing DevOps has had a big cultural impact on how we approach the software and systems we write and operate.</p>

<p><a href="http://davehogue.com/">David Hogue</a>, a leading Interaction Designer and instructor at San Francisco State University, kicked off the second day talking about the importance of interaction design in business and software. Hogue&rsquo;s keynote was especially relevant to us as interaction designers play a prominent role in the creation and maintenance of our software.</p>

<p>As you can see from the two keynote videos, the visual theme for DevCon this year was 8-bit gaming. Two 1980’s living room setups, packed with vintage NES consoles, CRT televisions, and piles of classic games, provided entertainment and nostalgia during the breaks in the conference schedule. At night, 20 teams competed for bragging rights and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Duo">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">prizes</a> at Geek Trivia Night, answering questions ranging from <em>name the sci-fi spaceships</em> to <em>identify the programming language from a snippet of code</em>.</p>
<p>As in previous years, DevCon ends with lightning talks in which anyone can present on a topic of their choosing provided it lasts for no more than 5 minutes. Lightning talks at DevCon can cover the gamut. Past lightning talks have covered Monads in Scala, a visual tour of Comic-Con, and world record strategies in Donkey Kong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made available the DevCon 2012 keynote presentations, both from <a href="http://drjeffnorris.com/">Dr. Jeff Norris</a>, a scientist at NASA JPL responsible for the robotic spacecraft in the solar system. Norris talked on remaining agile while working on mission critical systems as well as the importance of specialization in the advancement of fields &ndash; both of these talks are well worth watching.</p>
<p>DevCon allows engineers across organizations to come together to learn and present on a variety of topics, fostering a culture of innovation. It is no wonder then that many engineers at Cerner cite DevCon as their favorite and most anticipated event within Cerner.</p>

                When I graduated from college, I thought I understood what it meant to develop software in the real world. It required process. It required troubleshooting. It required quality. However, to me, process meant waterfall. Troubleshooting meant trying a few things and then asking for help. Quality meant manual testing.
Agile methods were not unheard of when I graduated in 2001. My professors noted that iterative development was better than waterfall; they just only taught waterfall.

                In software development, we solve problems. As we solve these problems, we build connections in our minds of how to look at a problem, relate it to previous problems and solutions, and re-apply past approaches and techniques.
These behavior habits build dogmatic ways of thinking and limit design choices to selective technologies we’ve used in the past. As we all know, you have to continually learn new technologies and different ways of thinking to stay current in the ever-changing landscape of software development.

                Cerner places a high value on talent development programs offering students the experience to build practical and tangible skills for the modern work environment. As part of this focus, Cerner supports FIRST Robotics, a competition providing experience in software engineering, where students learn to deal with complexity, time constraints, quality, and technical communications. Sound familiar? I wish they had this program when I was a kid!
High school students from Kansas City will be testing their minds, willpower, and teamwork in this global robotics championship competition April 24-27 in St Louis, Missouri.
