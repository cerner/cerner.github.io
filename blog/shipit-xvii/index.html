<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>During this ShipIt challenge, our team&rsquo;s goal is to create a dashboard that tracks newly discovered <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">CVEs</a> and displays any affected Cerner artifacts. The Z3R0 D4Y dashboard is a centralized place where teams can quickly go to identify and remediate any new security vulnerabilities and threats.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>New security vulnerabilities come up every day and keeping up with the latest updates can be tough. To take a more proactive response, we needed a way to get real-time updates of the latest vulnerabilities and identify which Cerner artifacts are affected.</p>
<p>But where can we get this data?</p>
<h2 id="our-solution-z3r0-d4y">Our Solution: Z3R0 D4Y</h2>
<p>We created the Z3R0 D4Y dashboard (shown below) to help solve this problem. The dashboard gives an overview of different CVEs and which products are affected.</p>
<div align="center">
    <figure class="figure">
        <a href="Z3R0_D4Y_DASHBOARD_summary_view.png" class="d-block" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="post-gallery">
            <img src="Z3R0_D4Y_DASHBOARD_summary_view.png"class="figure-img img-fluid"
            /> 
        </a>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>It then allows you to drill in and see details about the affected products. Below is an example of a test app to show a vulnerability.</p>
<div align="center">

            <img src="Z3R0_D4Y_DASHBOARD_detailed_view.png"class="figure-img img-fluid"
            /> 
        </a>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>The project is comprised of two components: the backend engine and the dashboard site.</p>
<p>The engine subscribes to the National Vulnerability Database (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD</a>). The NVD provides a collection of <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds#JSON_FEED">data feeds</a> of published vulnerabilities which are updated approximately every two hours. The Z3R0 D4Y engine runs nightly to retrieve the list of most <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds#JSON_FEED">recently discovered CVEs</a>. The data then is parsed to identify details of the new CVEs and the list of vulnerable dependencies. Using the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>,  the engine then checks all of Cerner&rsquo;s artifacts available in Github for matches based on that project’s dependency file. In Ruby, this would be the Gemfile.lock, for example. Finally, it publishes the findings to the Z3R0 D4Y dashboard.</p>
<p>The dashboard site is a simple Github page that displays all CVEs, their description, publish date, and affected artifacts. Its content is updated automatically nightly whenever the engine produces new data. The site also supports sorting and searching across the CVEs and Cerner artifacts data.</p>
<h2 id="other-shipit-day-winners">Other ShipIt Day Winners</h2>
<h3 id="second-place-nudgers">Second Place: nudgers</h3>
<p>The nudgers teamed up to create a ‘Nudge’ behavior-changing native iOS or Android application that can be quickly delivered to Cerner Associates to begin using. The app has users select a single behavior they’d like to improve upon (drink more water, less screen time, etc), they will manually enter their day’s total, and the app will begin ‘nudging’ them to make small changes based on their entries</p>

<p>This team worked on part two of a previous project they had worked on in a ShipIt Day, which is a virtual ICU Mobile Cart. In this hackathon they were able to implement device event listeners, encounter and location device association, conference calling integration, and data calls to the eHospital API.</p>

                Finishing our 16th occurrence of the series, our quarterly ShipIt Day hackathon invites the makers and innovators to come out and share new ways to think about our daily work here at Cerner. Whether it’s experimenting with new features or improving our developer workflows, ShipIt Day gives our engineers a chance to try and learn new things. This ShipIt day in particular had some exciting projects that melded hardware and software.

                It is winter time in Kansas City, which also included our fourteenth edition of ShipIt, our routine hackathon competition we host at Cerner Engineering. Although the snowy weather may have kept participants between the warm walls of our Innovations Campus, the winter storm did not disturb the initiative and enthusiasm of the fourteen participating teams. Check out the video below to hear from ShipIt Day participants and supporters as to why ShipIt Day has become an engineering-wide program that supports Cerner’s development culture.

                What does it take to be awarded the ShipIt Day Golden Keyboard?    ShipIt Day XIII concluded last week after an intense 24-hours of brainstorming, building, and presenting. Various projects were completed by Cerner associates across twelve diverse organizations. ShipIt Day XIII’s projects were some of the most technically advanced this competition has ever seen.
Awarding the Golden Keyboard is no easy job for our judges. Back in 2014, the trophy was created to provide the winning team with a memento that was unique and grew with the competition.
