                            <p>One year ago this month, Cerner development associates in Kansas City moved into a new place to call home for their workdays, Innovations Campus. The first two towers that stand on this campus provide 805,000 square feet of workspace for more than 3,000 associates. Eventually, the campus will grow larger, including 16 buildings and 16,000 Cerner associates. As that growth approaches, it is important to reflect on what these first two towers represent for associates and their development careers at Cerner. The investment in this workplace is a testament to Cerner‚Äôs dedication to and appreciation of associate values. It is a reflection of who the people at Cerner are and what they strive to be.</p>
<p>Many of the features in the building were designed with input by associates, for associates.  Other spaces and elements of the building were voted on by associates. A Momentum Wall, a series of installations that change and grow with Cerner‚Äôs culture and development platforms, capturing architectural history, open source projects and commits, a giant monthly calendar of events, and a continuously changing installation showcasing Cerner‚Äôs commitment to usability and solid design. Distinct ‚ÄúNeighborhood Nodes‚Äù were designed by committees of development associates to provide opportunities for associate to relax, learn, and create. The game rooms Bowser‚Äôs Castle and Flynn‚Äôs Arcade are a nod to the sci-fi and gaming culture popular among many development associates at Cerner. The Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings libraries house books and quiet work space for associates to get away and learn. The MakerSpace provides space, machinery and materials for associates to work on personal projects and think about work projects in a different way. Associates voted on various options for workstations and landed on a configurable option that provides flexibility in terms of work space and style. The Assembly provides a space for associates to share and learn, and creates opportunities for ambient conversations for those passing through a meetup or knowledge transfer session. On a normal workday at Innovations you can see how the physical elements embedded in the buildings contribute immensely to our development culture, from the collaborative layout of the campus with unique seating and whiteboards around every corner to unique representations of Cerner‚Äôs values and history composed in binary ascii. The functionality and aesthetics of the campus have enhanced the cultural experiences associates have had over the past year. In honor of the one year anniversary in Innovations, we‚Äôve asked a few of our associates for their perspectives on the parts of the campus they interact with daily.</p>

<p>I love the MakerSpace Neighborhood Node. Not only because it‚Äôs given me a chance to learn and use tools I have never used before, but for the networking experience it has turned out to be. I‚Äôve met dozens of associates across Cerner while babysitting a 3D print, or attending the Makerspace learning events the admins host.</p>
<p>We put together a group for ShipIt IX, where we used the MakerSpace to design and create a 3D printed notification template that hooked up with an Arduino and LED light strip we programmed to give the user notifications from their desired apps. ShipIt was a first for all of us, and we wouldn‚Äôt have had a project without the availability of the MakerSpace to do 3D printing and soldering. We all had a blast, learned a lot, and plan on doing another ShipIt in the future. Plus, now I have some great embarrassing photos of my team feeding each other ice cream and failing to properly use the outdoor exercise equipment because of the ShipIt scavenger hunt challenge. The funny thing is the MakerSpace is the one neighborhood node I did not vote for when the new Innovations was being built. I had never used a 3D printer, CNC, or laser cutter and, not knowing how, I wasn‚Äôt able to imagine a personal use for those tools. But the MakerSpace team put together great tutorials in their training and connected me to resources like Thingiverse and other associates co-using the space that now I am using the space at least once a month to create decorations or make utility pieces for around the house or office. The entire MakerSpace community has been a wonderful addition to my overall experience working here at Cerner. I‚Äôve enjoyed the people, the projects, and the enthusiasm to help each other and share ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Innovations campus shows us that Cerner is a company you can grow with. The old Innovations campus (I‚Äôm still refusing to call it Realizations) wasn‚Äôt designed for programmers, and certainly not for as many as we have. My team is as collaborative as ever, but now we have space to focus and get good work done. The all wifi floors perfectly represent everyone‚Äôs preference to remain wireless (untethered) during the day.</p>
<p>My favorite feature of the campus is the Assembly. I‚Äôve run the Python Developers‚Äô Meetup since its inception across the road (at the former campus), and I remember how ill-suited the game room (8 byte caf√©) was for it. The Assembly is perfect for meetups of any size, and the self-service microphones and projector rock. The DE Tech Talks we‚Äôve had there have all been fantastic, and the external speakers‚Äô Tech Talks are always good as well. When there‚Äôs not something going on, the furniture surrounding the Assembly is comfortable, and there‚Äôs plenty of outlets for working away from your desk without your battery dying.</p>

<p>In many ways I feel the new campus is a reflection of the cultural shift Cerner took over half a decade ago to create a fun, creative, and interactive development culture. The cafeteria is practically a food court, offering a range of diverse choices that reflect our many individual associates‚Äô tastes. The work areas are open, and modular, allowing for easy communication between associates; and creativity in customizing your work environment. The many nodes on campus offer creative outlets for innovative minds. Revenue Cycle uses Bowser‚Äôs Castle for monthly after work board game meetups. These are not only fun, but great ways to network within our organization. My team has even decided a few times to stay on campus rather than going out for team lunches and play board games over lunch. These have been great opportunities to bond, and become more relaxed around each other.</p>

                On December 14th and 15th, 18 teams of Cerner associates competed for the Golden Trophy during our tenth ShipIt Day. Being this was our tenth, it was fun to reflect back on how this event started and how much it has grown.
 It has been great to see ShipIt Days start from small hackathons organically run by individual teams to now an engineering-wide quarterly event that brings together engineers from disparate organizations, allowing for a better cross-pollination of ideas and team members.

                There is no better way to end summer than with ShipIt Day! We kicked off our ninth ShipIt Day on August 10th, with more than 75 Cerner associates signed up. Nineteen different teams worked for 24 hours straight to complete their projects. For those unfamiliar with the event, ShipIt Day is a 24 hour hackathon for internal associates to create something innovative, usable, and value-adding. This was the second ShipIt held at our new Innovations Campus.
