<p>During this 24-hour event, the team created a capacity meter for Cerner’s DC/OS cluster. The focus was to map out the potential for failure within a DC/OS cluster based on hardware constraints: CPU / Memory / Disk space. Every hour the meter will sample the usage and display the currently most used resource. During the live demo seen below, CPU is the most utilized at just under 70%. Colorful LEDs were used to signify which hardware type is currently displayed. As the DC/OS cluster hits 95% a trigger will flash the red LED to alert that the cluster is nearly at capacity.</p>
<p>The code as well as additional notes on the project can be found in the public GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/mboveri/dcos_meter">https://github.com/mboveri/dcos_meter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Place- Sparkling Darlings:</strong> Aakash Pydi, Gunjan Kaphle, James Freeman, Jokongir Rikhsiboev, &amp; Cory Tenbarge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this project, the team worked on prototyping their team&rsquo;s user experience monitoring (UEM) jobs using <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>.</p>
<p>The UEM jobs currently run a series of giant aggregation summarizing SQL queries on our <a href="https://www.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> cluster. This leads to issues such as (i) significant lag in data availability, (ii) giant, unintuitive SQL challenging to support and debug, (iii) the addition of significant load to our Vertica cluster, (iv) the load added to Vertica being &lsquo;inefficient&rsquo;.  If these jobs were in Spark, it would be much more efficient, have near real time data availability, and be significantly easier to debug and support. It also could potentially leverage Spark libraries for machine learning and graph processing.</p>
<p>The more general goal is to set up an incremental development and adoption strategy, for a Spark powered aggregation, summarization, and analytics layer in the team&rsquo;s data architecture. This will be an immensely valuable tool in the team&rsquo;s arsenal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3rd Place- Syug Looc:</strong> Eric Vue, Minhaz Abdullah, Zach Miller, Tarun Kolla, Sydne Anchutz &amp; Zachary Herridge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project focused on making the <a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/blog/devacademy-six-years-later/">Dev Academy</a> process more accessible to new hires at Cerner. While going through training, there is a very specific development process that associates must follow. The documentation for different parts of this process are currently hosted in multiple locations and sometimes contradicts itself. To fix this, the team developed a Chrome extension. The Chrome extension modeled a checklist to keep track of each step of the process per development task. It also cataloged the instructions and requirements for each step of the process and provided useful links to documentation to minimize errors. There were also quick links that allowed the user to jump between Jira/Crucible/GitHub/Jenkins for each task assigned to them. The use of this extension will make development in the Dev Academy much more efficient and reduce user error.</p>

                It is winter time in Kansas City, which also included our fourteenth edition of ShipIt, our routine hackathon competition we host at Cerner Engineering. Although the snowy weather may have kept participants between the warm walls of our Innovations Campus, the winter storm did not disturb the initiative and enthusiasm of the fourteen participating teams. Check out the video below to hear from ShipIt Day participants and supporters as to why ShipIt Day has become an engineering-wide program that supports Cerner’s development culture.

                What does it take to be awarded the ShipIt Day Golden Keyboard?    ShipIt Day XIII concluded last week after an intense 24-hours of brainstorming, building, and presenting. Various projects were completed by Cerner associates across twelve diverse organizations. ShipIt Day XIII’s projects were some of the most technically advanced this competition has ever seen.
Awarding the Golden Keyboard is no easy job for our judges. Back in 2014, the trophy was created to provide the winning team with a memento that was unique and grew with the competition.

                This month we held our quarterly hackathon event- called ShipIt Day. We would like to thank all the participants for making ShipIt Day XII a huge success. With 75 participants, we had associates representing 13 different organizations across Cerner. These associates were given 24-hours to meet the requirements of this hackathon which included making something that was innovative, usable, and value-adding. As the clock ticked down, our associates worked in their teams to complete a project while taking some time to enjoy the fun activities happening throughout ShipIt day.
