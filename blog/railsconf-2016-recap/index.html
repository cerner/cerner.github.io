<p>RailsConf 2016 took place in the heart of downtown Kansas City. From day one, the atmosphere was buzzing. We usually send a few engineers to RailsConf every year, but since it was in Kansas City, we were lucky enough to send 50+ engineers to soak up all of the knowledge and news that was being shared across three session-filled days.</p>

</div>
<p>We were a silver sponsor this year, which provided us with a booth space where we could share Cerner&rsquo;s story with Rails developers from across the world.</p>
<div align="center">
    <figure class="figure">

            /> 
        </a>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>In addition to meeting all of the wonderful Rails developers and getting the chance to tell them about Cerner and how we are huge into Rails, we also had some fun at our booth with some multiplayer gaming action&hellip;</p>
<div align="center">
    <figure class="figure">

<p>&hellip;and our daily raffles. We gave away some some awesome BBQ from Joe&rsquo;s KC and a Phantom 3 Professional drone. Congratulations to both winners.</p>

<p>And for even more fun, we hosted one of the official after parties after the closing Day 1 keynote at No Other Pub. During the party, RailsConf attendees got a chance to mingle and talk to our developers and architects in a casual setting…and the free food and drinks certainly made for a great time.</p>

<p>RailsConf 2016 was a great event, and the fact that it was in our backyard, was icing on the cake. We wish it would be held in Kansas City every year, but we are already looking forward to <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf/status/728712538897027072">RailsConf 2017 in sunny Phoenix, AZ</a>.</p>

                ShipIt Day is an all day, all night hackathon with the goal of building something awesome, usable, and value-adding within the given 24 hours. This Spring marked our fifth ShipIt Day, with participation and reach growing with each event.
We kicked off the event at 10 AM on Thursday, when teams broke out and got to work and stopped only for food and caffeine. Many stayed until a few hours after dinner arrived, several stayed all night and took naps in their workspace, and a few worked through the whole night.

Many of the open source projects we use and contribute to are under the ASF umbrella, so supporting the mission and work of the ASF is important to us.
We’re happy to announce that Cerner has now increased our sponsorship of the ASF to become a silver-level sponsor. Open source continues to play an integral role in both our architecture and engineering culture.

                At the end of March, some of our teams held their first 24-hour hackathon, titled ShipIt: Millennium&#43; Services FedEx Day. We had 41 participants, in 15 teams working on 15 unique projects. The idea was inspired by several teams spending a few hours every so often to work on different projects. After reading about Atlassian’s hack days, we decided to hold one.
The event was initially announced early in February, to give teams time to work this into their project plans.
