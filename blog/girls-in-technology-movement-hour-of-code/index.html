<p>The girls worked in pairs to complete exercises using coding constructs.  The exercises from <a href="https://code.org/learn">code.org</a> followed a Star Wars theme and included things like moving a robot and escaping Stormtroopers while earning points for certain events. The intent of the event was for it to be easy to learn even for those who have no experience with code. Blocks of code had to be put together to accomplish the tasks. They could then run the code to see what happens and how it needed to be adjusted to work next time if the desired outcome wasn’t reached the first run through. A few pairs were enjoying it so much that they finished early and used the time to work on the Minecraft one as well. It was great to see them enjoying it so much that they didn’t want to stop.</p>

<p>The girls at this event came for various reasons, from genuine interest in technology and coding to just wanting to get out of school and go on a fun trip. And who can blame them, right? It was a fun event! They learned teamwork through working in pairs, bouncing ideas back and forth to figure out the solution to the problem. Some of them would get excited when they figured out the harder problems. It reminded me of that feeling I get when working on a project and finally figuring out a tough part that had been stumping me for awhile. If you work with code, you know that feeling.</p>
<p>After the exercises, the girls had the opportunity to talk with a female Cerner engineer. This was a chance for them to ask questions and learn more about what it’s like to be a software engineer. I spoke with a senior in high school who asked things about what college I attended, what types of classes I took, how I like my job, and what I do. I was able to share some of the fun events we have at Cerner like DevCon and Programmer’s Day.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any exposure to coding in school until I got to college, so seeing these middle and high school girls get the opportunity to see what coding and the technology industry is like is awesome. I’m glad to see something like this being put together and to have the chance to be a part of it.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
                At Cerner, we use Chef to automate our deployments across a very large distributed system comprised of many thousands of nodes. While we employ ServerSpec and Test Kitchen extensively to test our Chef recipes, this still doesn’t identify all possible failure scenarios. In a large distributed system such as ours, we occasionally run into connectivity failures between machines due to network ACL issues. This could be due to a variety of reasons.

                Currently in the world of JavaScript these options are what we most commonly use to generate logs:
 console.log console.info console.warn console.error  These are actually pretty good in most modern browsers. Even if you go back to Internet Explorer 8 console.log and friends work as long as you have the developer tools open.
Given that we have these logging utilities what is the problem with using them? When in local development these are just fine for helping debug and speed up development.

                Our team works on a patient facing web application with a thousand live clients with 2,315,000&#43; users. On an average, the high traffic results into more than 40,000 visits and 300,000 page views daily generating about 30,000 logging events. A considerable portion of these events are of information and warning level in order to aid proactive monitoring or identify potential issues due to clients’ misconfiguration.
Before Splunk To handle this large volume of logging, our team created a rotational support role to manually monitor the logs at regular intervals daily.
