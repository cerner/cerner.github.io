At Cerner, we use the latest technologies to transform healthcare. We are the engineers and designers that focus on making you, your family, and friends healthy and happy.

We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot programming, distributed systems, and [open source]({% post_url 2014-01-16-cerner-and-open-source %}).

We also know that it’s important to allow engineers to take a step back to learn and try new things. That’s why we host periodic hackathons, meetups, [tech talks]({% post_url 2013-11-12-cerner-tech-talks %}), and an [annual internal two-day developers conference]({% post_url 2013-08-26-devcon %}). We also love to attend, sponsor, and speak at conferences.

If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to work together. Get it touch with us [here](http://www.cerner.com/careers).
