            <img src="/open_source/scrimp.png" alt="Scrimp" />
            <p>
              This is a tool for testing Thrift services via a web browser (analogous to how you might
              test web services using a browser-based REST client). Given the IDL files for the services,
              it provides a UI to help construct requests, invoke services, and display formatted responses.

            <img src="/open_source/GC_Stats.png" alt="GC Stats" />
            <p>
              gc_stats is a Ruby gem for Rails applications that collects and logs garbage collection
              statistics during each request. GC statistics are only logged if a GC event is detected.
              This allows you to track and analyze the GC characteristics of your Rails application.

              monitoring via Stagemonitor, API docs via Swagger, JSON serialization via Jackson, and
              integration of these components with Guice.
