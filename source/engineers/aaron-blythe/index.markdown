{% engineer about %}

I have been working at Cerner since a cold day in January 2003.  Initially I wrote Visual C++ in the Visual Studio 6 IDE or msdev.exe.  I wrote a lot of code for UI elements.  I have always loved the hardest problems so naturally gravitated toward fixing exceptions and recreating seeming unrepeatable incidents from log files.  Today I am still fascinated with logging, deployment, and monitoring.  The industry just has a name for it now, DevOps.  I lead the Operations Infrastructure team.  The tech that I use daily has migrated to from Windows to Mac (development) and Linux (production), however I still run directly toward the hardest problem I can find.  I work with open source and vendor software to help streamline our modern operations.  Our weapons of choice currently are Chef, Splunk and Zabbix.

I rock the 15” Macbook Pro.  It is much lighter and I tend to drop it less than my previous 17” MBP.

{% engineer software %}

Looking at my App Bar right now - Sublime Text, 100+ tabs in Firefox, Slack Chat, Activity Monitor (to look for Vagrant or Test-Kitchen boxes I left running), EverNote, Colloquy for IRC, Outlook and my command line Terminal with about 10 tabs.  This is typical.  There is usually a ruby process crunching on something, likely a Chef cookbook.

A beach would be best with a breeze and an umbrella.  Time to get lost in the codes.  Way more RAM than I have now (at any given time) on a MacBook Pro laptop with my retina view.
