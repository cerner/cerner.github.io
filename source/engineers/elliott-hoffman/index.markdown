{% engineer about %}

I design healthcare apps by day and make people laugh by night. My current focus is on internationalizing [Cerner's Patient Portal](https://iqhealth.com/) — a web app that lets over 1.2 million users view and manage their health information. My stack of choice is [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Previously I was an engineering team lead and manager. Before that I was zygote… wait, is that too far back?

When not engineering health, I'm on stage with an improv comedy troupe. I love performing comedy in front of an audience: creating fun characters, playing with super smart and funny performers and getting a good laugh!

If you have any indie-electro music recommendations, let me know.


{% engineer hardware %}

A beast of a 17" MacBook Pro with SSD and 16 GB of RAM powers my work day. At home I keep it low-key; mostly just an iPad. For music: an 88-key fully weighted digital piano.

A Fangshi Shuang Ren Magic (Rubik's) cube eats up idle clock cycles.

{% engineer software %}

Zsh + Sublime Text + git/svn + Textual (IRC) + Evernote.

{% engineer dream %}

Give me an iPhone with the power of my 17" MBP that I can drop in a docking station with two 4k monitors, full keyboard and a magic trackpad — I mean a *literal* magic trackpad. We're talking wizard powers.

Give me a full-size midi controller complete with dials, pads and sliders; one that I can roll up like a map but becomes rigid when powered on.
