We are always looking for ways to share knowledge and learn new things within engineering at Cerner. Whether that be through meetups, lunch & learns, conferences, or [DevCon](https://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devcon/), we have a variety of outlets available to us.

Today, we’re announcing a new program we recently launched: Cerner Tech Talks.

Cerner Tech Talks brings in great speakers for talks that would be of interest to engineers at Cerner. These talks will be held periodically and will vary widely in their content. Each talk will be recorded and available for viewing via our [Cerner Engineering YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/CernerEng).

Last week, we held our first tech talk, which you can view below. [Robert Binder](http://www.robertvbinder.com/), an accomplished software testing expert, presented on model-driven development.
