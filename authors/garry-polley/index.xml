      <description>Currently in the world of JavaScript these options are what we most commonly use to generate logs:
 console.log console.info console.warn console.error  These are actually pretty good in most modern browsers. Even if you go back to Internet Explorer 8 console.log and friends work as long as you have the developer tools open.
Given that we have these logging utilities what is the problem with using them? When in local development these are just fine for helping debug and speed up development.</description>
