      <description>At Cerner, associates are always encouraged to develop tools and methods to improve their productivity. With this year&amp;rsquo;s theme being &amp;ldquo;Engineering Productivity,&amp;rdquo; Cerner&amp;rsquo;s fourth annual 2^5 Coding Competition provided associates another opportunity to dive into this subject and get involved in Cerner&amp;rsquo;s development culture.
As usual, this year&amp;rsquo;s 2^5 Coding Competition was kicked off alongside Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Day festivities on September 13th. The competition lasts 32 days, and associates are encouraged to submit code every day.</description>
