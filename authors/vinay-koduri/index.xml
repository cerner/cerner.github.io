      <description>Background In order to manage the health of populations, Cerner builds data-driven solutions built on top of its HealtheIntent℠ platform. The platform transforms and standardizes data across disparate health systems. The data is then used in algorithms that aid healthcare providers and hospitals in managing and monitoring health both at a person and population level.
The Reference Record is one of the core components of the HealtheIntent platform. It represents the data known about a person&amp;rsquo;s health from a particular source of healthcare information.</description>
