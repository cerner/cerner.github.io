      <description>We are pleased to announce the release of CCL Unit and CCL Testing as open source code projects, as well as the release of the CCL Testing plugin artifacts to Maven Central.
Cerner Command Language (CCL) is a database query and scripting language used with Cerner Millennium databases. CCL Unit is a unit testing framework for CCL written in CCL. The CCL Testing plugins generate reports for viewing the results of CCL Unit tests and static analyses of CCL programs and for generating code documentation from comments in the source code for CCL programs.</description>
