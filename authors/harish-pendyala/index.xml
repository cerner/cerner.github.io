      <description>ShipIt Day, Cerner Engineering’s 24-hour hackathon, provides associates an environment to be creative, work on new projects, and network with other associates. This event is one of the many things that sit at the core of our Engineering Culture at Cerner, and is rapidly growing- now being hosted globally in Romania, Sweden, India, and the UK. In October, our team had the chance to participate in the seventeenth ShipIt Day at Kansas City’s Innovations Campus and managed to take home the Golden Keyboard trophy as the first place team!</description>
