      <description>Last fall our team (Mike Tweten, Trevin Teacutter, and Zameer Sura) started working on the problem of automating DC/OS deployments in a way that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require multiple teams to duplicate effort and tie themselves directly to DC/OS APIs. While DC/OS certainly makes the act of deploying an application much easier than anything we&amp;rsquo;ve used previously, there are still many different ways you could choose to layer on deployment strategies and integrate with continuous delivery systems.</description>
