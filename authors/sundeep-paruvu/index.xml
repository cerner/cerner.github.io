      <description>Beadledom is a framework for building Java based web services. It bundles several open sourced components required for building JAX-RS services.
Why? HealtheIntent, Cerner’s population health management platform, started 3.5 years ago. We went through the process of investigating different technologies for the platform. We decided on using Java for building services and arrived on a set of libraries that we believed work well together.
The long history of Java has led to an ocean of libraries that are available to Java developers.</description>
