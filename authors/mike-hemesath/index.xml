      <description>Our team works on a patient facing web application with a thousand live clients with 2,315,000+ users. On an average, the high traffic results into more than 40,000 visits and 300,000 page views daily generating about 30,000 logging events. A considerable portion of these events are of information and warning level in order to aid proactive monitoring or identify potential issues due to clients’ misconfiguration.
Before Splunk To handle this large volume of logging, our team created a rotational support role to manually monitor the logs at regular intervals daily.</description>
