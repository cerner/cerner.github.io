We are excited to congratulate our own Michelle Brush for receiving the Rising Trendsetter STEMMY award. The Rising Trendsetter Award is given to a woman in STEMM areas with less than 20 years of experience and has demonstrated significant achievements early in their career.

Michelle is a director at Cerner who manages an engineering team in population health as well as a team dedicated to improving Cerner’s development culture. One of Michelle’s most notable career accomplishments was her leadership role in reconstructing Cerner’s software engineer development program in 2013, which she personally oversaw until the end of 2014 (read about the details of this program in her [blog](http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devacademy/)). In 2014, she transitioned into an executive role in the Population Health platform, where she fields particularly tricky support issues to help resolve data inconsistencies. Since 2014, Michelle has also managed the Development Culture team at Cerner, a team that focuses on improving associate morale through cultural empowerment, encouraging and providing opportunities for collaboration and innovation, and growing Cerner’s presence in the technical community.
 
Michelle actively promotes women entering and growing their STEMM careers through her leadership in the community and at Cerner. She is an integral member of Cerner’s women in tech committee, which has the goal to provide development, networking and leadership opportunities to women in technical roles in a supportive and inclusive environment that promotes authenticity and values differences. Additionally, she is a member of several other leadership councils ranging from helping design the new software engineer campus, improving development culture across the company, and intern planning.
 
In the community, Michelle is also a local chapter leader of [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/kansas-city), a nonprofit organization that provides affordable programs for adult women interested in learning web and software development. Michelle is also an organizer of [Midwest.io](http://www.midwest.io/), a two-day industry tech conference in Kansas City that brings together developers across the Midwest for an eclectic collection of talks covering the latest trends, best practices, and research in the field of computing. As a member of the organizing team, she defines the vision for the conference, which includes finding speakers, promoting the conference in the industry, and ensuring diversity is top of mind at the conference.
 
Michelle also actively speaks at tech conferences, and has spoken at conferences like OSCON, CityCode, O’Reilly’s Software Architecture Conference, and Strange Loop. Michelle is also a MSU Computer Science Board Member.

Congratulations, Michelle!
