In June, we had the pleasure of having Mat Warger join us in our [Tech Talk series at Oracle Cerner](/tech-talks). Mat is a senior software developer based in Kansas City. He enjoys learning new concepts and has leveraged this curiosity in positions ranging from startups to the enterprise over the past decade. He is a co-organizer of the JavaScript KC meetup group and organizer of GraphQL KC meetup group. He can be found chasing the latest and (sometimes) greatest in a wide range of languages and platforms, including React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and the cloud. 

His talk Rock Solid Components with Typescript and GraphQL will discusses how the features of TypeScript can be leveraged to bring clarity and dependability when constructing components with React. Using TypeScript can help to catch errors early in the development life-cycle. GraphQL and its type system can ensure confidence in your components while fetching remote data. This comprehensive approach ensures that your components behave as you expect, and allows you to eliminate run-time errors. Learn how using types can keep your users happy!

We hope you enjoy Mat's talk!
