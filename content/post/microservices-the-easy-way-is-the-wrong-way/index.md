We had the great opportunity of inviting Sean Whitesell to join us for a virtual Tech Talk in August to share his knowledge on Microservices. Sean is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma and is a Senior Cloud Architect, ASP Insider, and a Microsoft MVP. For the past nine years, Sean has served as the leader of the Tulsa.NET User Group. Last January, he also published his own book, [Pro Microservices in .NET 6
With Examples Using ASP.NET Core 6, MassTransit, and Kubernetes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7833-8), alongside two other Microsoft MVPs.

Sean shares his expertise in this session by demonstrating how a microservice architecture requires far more thought than one might assume. Throughout his presentation, Sean explores the benefits and drawbacks of creating microservices, and why it makes sense to establish them. The presentation goes into when and how to get started creating microservices through a high-level decompensation example and discussing domain driven design. There is a lot to consider as a team before creating a microservice, but Sean puts it best by saying “Microservices are hard, but so is good programming.” We hope you enjoy this Tech Talk!
