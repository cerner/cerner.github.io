Open source plays an integral role within engineering at Cerner. In addition to using open source software throughout our architecture, we [recently released a few projects]({{<ref "/post/cerner-and-open-source">}}) back to the community via our [Github organization](https://github.com/cerner).

Today, we’re happy to announce that [Cerner is now a sponsor](http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html) of the non-profit [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) (ASF). The ASF is home to several projects that are essential components in many of our systems. We’ve blogged previously about several of these projects: [Hadoop, HBase, Crunch]({{<ref "/post/composable-mapreduce-with-hadoop-and-crunch">}}), [Maven]({{<ref "/post/cerner-and-tycho">}}), and [Storm]({{<ref "/post/near-real-time-processing-over-hadoop-and-hbase">}}). In addition to these projects, there are dozens of other ASF projects that we use and have contributed to via patches and enhancements.

Sponsoring the ASF allows us to show support for their mission and to ensure the ASF can continue to provide infrastructure and resources for the open source projects they host.
