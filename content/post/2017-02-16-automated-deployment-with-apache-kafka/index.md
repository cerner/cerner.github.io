It's likely not a surprise that Cerner would use [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)
as we have used a number of related technologies like [Apache Hadoop](http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/02/composable-mapreduce-with-hadoop-and-crunch/)
along with its Map/Reduce, HDFS and even [Apache HBase](http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/02/near-real-time-processing-over-hadoop-and-hbase/).
Our team first started using Apache Kafka in 2014
when Kafka 0.8 first came out. Since then we've expanded to using Kafka for a
number of different use cases
([1](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/11/how-cerner-uses-cdh-with-apache-kafka/), [2](https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-2016-users-ingesting-complex-healthcare-data-with-apache-kafka))
and it has become a core piece of Cerner's infrastructure.

Just like the [applications we create](http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/deploying-web-services-with-apache-tomcat-and-chef/),
we also needed to automate the deployment of Kafka to handle the ever growing
amount of operations work and to ensure a high level of consistency with our
environments. [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) was an obvious choice for us since
its been our deployment tool of choice for the last few years. We quickly put together a
[cookbook](https://github.com/cerner/cerner_kafka) to help us automate the
deployment of the many Kafka clusters here at Cerner. We have
[continued to support and use this cookbook](https://github.com/cerner/cerner_kafka/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
after open-sourcing it upgrading it to handle newer versions of Kafka (0.9, 0.10),
handle Kerberos authentication, and [many other improvements](https://github.com/cerner/cerner_kafka/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20).

If you use Apache Kafka, feel free to [try it out](https://github.com/cerner/cerner_kafka)
and let us know how it works for you.
