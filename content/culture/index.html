        We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot programming,
          distributed systems, and open source. We also know that it's important to allow engineers to take a step back
          and try new things. That's why we host periodic hackathons, meetups, tech talks, and an annual internal
          two-day developers conference in addition to attending, sponsoring, and speaking at industry conferences.

            We attend a lot of technology conferences, and we also sponsor conferences to show Cerner's support for
            the industry. Cerner engineers are getting their talks accepted at conferences like Strange Loop, OSCON,
            ApacheCon, Midwest.io, and more. We feel so strongly about Cerner engineers speaking at conferences that
            if your talk is accepted at a conference, we'll pay your way to go!

                  DevCon is an internal, engineering-led conference that was created to bring
                  together Cerner associates involved in all aspects of development and technology. DevCon is an
                  opportunity for associates to learn, interact with distinguished leaders in their profession, and
                  discuss significant topics to their specific role. The conference is intended to acknowledge the
                  work associates do and see it as a craft, exciting other developers and engineers alike to connect
                  and share ideas.

                  ShipIt is our 24 hour hackathon we routinely host throughout the year in Kansas
                  City, Malvern, Bangalore, and Brasov. We believe this encourages ingenuity and
                  collaboration by promoting cross-pollination of ideas and teams as they solve
                  problems together. Teams in KC compete for the coveted Golden Keyboard and Golden
                  Mouse trophies that travel the campus, each winning team adding a trinket to the
                  trophy representing their unique winning project.

            Today, the core technology behind many of our architectures and projects is open source.
            Participation in open source - both as consumers and as contributors - is a key component of our
            Engineering Culture strategy.  The software industry as a whole has proven time and again that
            some of the best ideas, most robust tools, and broadly used tools come from the bazaar. We find it
            important to not only consume and contribute to these projects, but to recognize the contributions
            of our associates and support organizations like the Apache Software Foundation that we benefit
            from.

          Cerner hosts a plethora of internal and external events for engineers to network and learn from their peers including
          coderetreats, hack nights, and meetups. We value the local tech community by sponsoring meetups, conferences,
          and hack events as well as encourage and recognize our associates that participate and/or lead those activities.
