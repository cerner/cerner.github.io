        We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot programming,
          distributed systems, and open source. We also know that it's important to allow engineers to take a step back
          and try new things. That's why we host periodic hackathons, meetups, tech talks, and an annual internal
          two-day developers conference in addition to attending, sponsoring, and speaking at industry conferences.

            We attend a lot of technology conferences, and we also sponsor conferences to show Cerner's support for
            the industry. Cerner engineers are getting their talks accepted at conferences like Strange Loop, OSCON,
            ApacheCon, Midwest.io, and more. We feel so strongly about Cerner engineers speaking at conferences that
            if your talk is accepted at a conference, we'll pay your way to go!

            <strong>DevCon</strong> is Cerner's internal two-day conference for associates across all roles in
            development. It's an opportunity for us to take time off from day-to-day work and share knowledge, get to
            know others, and have fun. In 2015, we had 90 talks, 3,100 attendees, and two keynotes. Check out the
            videos at <a href="http://youtube.com/user/CernerEng">youtube.com/user/CernerEng</a>.</p>

            Today, <strong>open source</strong> is the core technology behind many of our architectures and projects.
            Cerner is a silver sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation. We want to acknowledge our commitment to
            open source and support organizations like the ASF, which we benefit from.

          Cerner hosts a plethora of internal and external events for engineers to network and learn from their peers including
          coderetreats, hack nights, and meetups. We value the local tech community by sponsoring meetups, conferences,
          and hack events as well as encourage and recognize our associates that participate and/or lead those activities.
