At Cerner, we use the latest technologies to transform healthcare. We are the engineers and designers that focus on making you, your family, and friends healthy and happy.

We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot programming, distributed systems, and [open source]({{<ref "/post/cerner-and-open-source">}}).

We also know that it’s important to allow engineers to take a step back to learn and try new things. That’s why we host periodic hackathons, meetups, [tech talks]({{<ref "/post/cerner-tech-talks">}}), and an [annual internal two-day developers conference]({{<ref "/post/devcon">}}). We also love to attend, sponsor, and speak at conferences.

If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to work together. Get it touch with us [here](https://careers.cerner.com/paths/engineering--technology).
