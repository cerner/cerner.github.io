            Beadledom is a bundle of common components required for building JAX-RS web services.
            It is the starting point for new services. The core of Beadledom provides health checks,
            monitoring via Stagemonitor, API docs via Swagger, JSON serialization via Jackson, and
            integration of these components with Guice.

            Carbon is a graphing library built using D3 visualization library. It provides an API
            for generating native graphs such as Line and Paired Result graphs based on design
            standards.

          <img src="/open_source/GC_Stats.png" alt="GC Stats" />
          <p>
            gc_stats is a Ruby gem for Rails applications that collects and logs garbage collection
            statistics during each request. GC statistics are only logged if a GC event is detected.
            This allows you to track and analyze the GC characteristics of your Rails application.

          <p>
            This is a tool for testing Thrift services via a web browser (analogous to how you might
            test web services using a browser-based REST client). Given the IDL files for the services,
            it provides a UI to help construct requests, invoke services, and display formatted responses.
