    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Cerner, we manage our own infrastructure and a big part of that is managing F5 load balancers. If you are a Ruby developer or a network engineer and regularly work with F5s, then I have good news! I&rsquo;ve created a gem that abstracts iControl&rsquo;s REST API. It makes working with the API easy to understand and eases the effort required to automate changes across many devices.</p>

<p>After logging in, one can build a query via an instance method:</p>

<p>The gem builds REST queries given a method delimited by underscores. The first word is the REST method and the following words are the path you&rsquo;d like to send your request to.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;d like to get the version of the F5, given this <a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/d/icontrol-rest-api-reference-version-120">iControl REST API doc</a></p>

<p>You&rsquo;d call a method that looks like this:</p>

<p>This would print out the hostname and version of any F5s that aren&rsquo;t on version 12.0.0. This is just one example, I encourage you to look through the iControl REST API docs to get a feeling for what&rsquo;s really possible.</p>

    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/one-year-calling-innovations-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One year ago this month, Cerner development associates in Kansas City moved into a new place to call home for their workdays, Innovations Campus. The first two towers that stand on this campus provide 805,000 square feet of workspace for more than 3,000 associates. Eventually, the campus will grow larger, including 16 buildings and 16,000 Cerner associates. As that growth approaches, it is important to reflect on what these first two towers represent for associates and their development careers at Cerner. The investment in this workplace is a testament to Cerner’s dedication to and appreciation of associate values. It is a reflection of who the people at Cerner are and what they strive to be.</p>

<p>Many of the features in the building were designed with input by associates, for associates.  Other spaces and elements of the building were voted on by associates. A Momentum Wall, a series of installations that change and grow with Cerner’s culture and development platforms, capturing architectural history, open source projects and commits, a giant monthly calendar of events, and a continuously changing installation showcasing Cerner’s commitment to usability and solid design. Distinct “Neighborhood Nodes” were designed by committees of development associates to provide opportunities for associate to relax, learn, and create. The game rooms Bowser’s Castle and Flynn’s Arcade are a nod to the sci-fi and gaming culture popular among many development associates at Cerner. The Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings libraries house books and quiet work space for associates to get away and learn. The MakerSpace provides space, machinery and materials for associates to work on personal projects and think about work projects in a different way. Associates voted on various options for workstations and landed on a configurable option that provides flexibility in terms of work space and style. The Assembly provides a space for associates to share and learn, and creates opportunities for ambient conversations for those passing through a meetup or knowledge transfer session. On a normal workday at Innovations you can see how the physical elements embedded in the buildings contribute immensely to our development culture, from the collaborative layout of the campus with unique seating and whiteboards around every corner to unique representations of Cerner’s values and history composed in binary ascii. The functionality and aesthetics of the campus have enhanced the cultural experiences associates have had over the past year. In honor of the one year anniversary in Innovations, we’ve asked a few of our associates for their perspectives on the parts of the campus they interact with daily.</p>

<h4>Associate Reviewer: Ann Dickey, Software Engineer</h4>

<blockquote><p>I love the MakerSpace Neighborhood Node. Not only because it’s given me a chance to learn and use tools I have never used before, but for the networking experience it has turned out to be. I’ve met dozens of associates across Cerner while babysitting a 3D print, or attending the Makerspace learning events the admins host.</p>

<p>We put together a group for ShipIt IX, where we used the MakerSpace to design and create a 3D printed notification template that hooked up with an Arduino and LED light strip we programmed to give the user notifications from their desired apps. ShipIt was a first for all of us, and we wouldn’t have had a project without the availability of the MakerSpace to do 3D printing and soldering. We all had a blast, learned a lot, and plan on doing another ShipIt in the future. Plus, now I have some great embarrassing photos of my team feeding each other ice cream and failing to properly use the outdoor exercise equipment because of the ShipIt scavenger hunt challenge. The funny thing is the MakerSpace is the one neighborhood node I did not vote for when the new Innovations was being built. I had never used a 3D printer, CNC, or laser cutter and, not knowing how, I wasn’t able to imagine a personal use for those tools. But the MakerSpace team put together great tutorials in their training and connected me to resources like Thingiverse and other associates co-using the space that now I am using the space at least once a month to create decorations or make utility pieces for around the house or office. The entire MakerSpace community has been a wonderful addition to my overall experience working here at Cerner. I’ve enjoyed the people, the projects, and the enthusiasm to help each other and share ideas.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The new Innovations campus shows us that Cerner is a company you can grow with. The old Innovations campus (I’m still refusing to call it Realizations) wasn’t designed for programmers, and certainly not for as many as we have. My team is as collaborative as ever, but now we have space to focus and get good work done. The all wifi floors perfectly represent everyone’s preference to remain wireless (untethered) during the day.</p>

<p>My favorite feature of the campus is the Assembly. I’ve run the Python Developers’ Meetup since its inception across the road (at the former campus), and I remember how ill-suited the game room (8 byte café) was for it. The Assembly is perfect for meetups of any size, and the self-service microphones and projector rock. The DE Tech Talks we’ve had there have all been fantastic, and the external speakers’ Tech Talks are always good as well. When there’s not something going on, the furniture surrounding the Assembly is comfortable, and there’s plenty of outlets for working away from your desk without your battery dying.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In many ways I feel the new campus is a reflection of the cultural shift Cerner took over half a decade ago to create a fun, creative, and interactive development culture. The cafeteria is practically a food court, offering a range of diverse choices that reflect our many individual associates’ tastes. The work areas are open, and modular, allowing for easy communication between associates; and creativity in customizing your work environment. The many nodes on campus offer creative outlets for innovative minds. Revenue Cycle uses Bowser’s Castle for monthly after work board game meetups. These are not only fun, but great ways to network within our organization. My team has even decided a few times to stay on campus rather than going out for team lunches and play board games over lunch. These have been great opportunities to bond, and become more relaxed around each other.</p></blockquote>

<p>On December 14th and 15th, 18 teams of Cerner associates competed for the Golden Trophy during our tenth ShipIt Day. Being this was our tenth, it was fun to reflect back on how this event started and how much it has grown.</p>

<blockquote><p>It has been great to see ShipIt Days start from small hackathons organically run by individual teams to now an engineering-wide quarterly event that brings together engineers from disparate organizations, allowing for a better cross-pollination of ideas and team members. &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/kpshek">Kevin Shekleton</a></p></blockquote>

        This was our third ShipIt Day hosted at our new Innovations campus. It continues to be a great location for ShipIt because of our awesome game rooms and collaboration spaces. As part of this ShipIt, we had a sponsored theme, which focused on building React applications using <a href="https://github.com/cerner/kaiju">Kaiju</a> that are based on Cerner&#8217;s consistent <a href="http://terra-ui.herokuapp.com/home">Terra UI</a> theme. Team members that support these projects were available to help participants if they wished to use these technologies, helping to gain more feedback on the projects, and to expand the exposure of these projects to ShipIt teams. By including this theme, we also introduced a new category for someone to win by using these projects.

<p>Second place went to Team ShipIt X Files (Santosh Manughala, Carlos Salazar, Matt Horn, Seada Ali).</p>

<blockquote><p>Our project was to create an application for discovering related database rows that let&rsquo;s the user quickly navigate back-end data in Millennium, (e.g. look up lots of useful info for a given personnel id, person id, or event id). Each bit of data could be clickable to do a new search on that id (search the person you found on a clinical event in one click). The app displays information so that it is easy to navigate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Way to go, Team ShipIT X Files!</p>

<h3>Team A Near Field Far Far Away</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2018-02-19-shipit-x-day-winter-2017/shipit-x-2.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Team A Near Field Far Far Away (Aurko Ghosh, Aaron Kaplan, Vijay Ayilavarapu, Nikhil Agrawal, Neil Pathare) took third place. Their project utilized our MakerSpace!</p>

<blockquote><p>For ShipIt, we assembled a 3D printed light bridge that provides 180% of bright light for the soldering workbench. In addition to assembly, we designed and attempted to implement an RGB LED controller using a Raspberry Pi 3 and mosfet chips. The controller uses both a physical switch, as well as a mobile app to control the lighting. The mobile app is developed using React Native, and communicates wirelessly with the controller via Near Field Communication (NFC).</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Chuck Schneider noted, &ldquo;I like that they took on a lot of different pieces, which adds to the complexity of the project.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Team Flying Mongoose</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2018-02-19-shipit-x-day-winter-2017/shipit-x-1.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>The winners of the sponsored project theme was a veteran team, Flying Mongoose (Mahesh Acharya, Taylor Clay, Cihan Kaynak, Matt Stramel). They were able to start the migration of <a href="https://www.cerner.com/solutions/automated-dispensing-cabinet">Cerner&rsquo;s RxStation</a> to a React application utilizing Terra UI. They were able to utilize Kaiju to build the prototype UI, which had dynamically loaded tables and mock buttons. By using ShipIt to start this transition, they were able to learn a lot of what it would take to make these next steps.</p>

<p>Nicely done Team Flying Mongoose!</p>

<h3>People&rsquo;s Choice Awards</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2018-02-19-shipit-x-day-winter-2017/shipit-x-9.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Each ShipIt Day, the projects get more intricate and more creative. The projects presented show off the talent we have. After surveying the participants on their projects, 45% of the projects were identified to improve daily work at Cerner. ShipIt Day remains one of our most popular dev culture events at Cerner.</p>

<p>First time participant, Ted Segal said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a new developer, I&rsquo;m still in the <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devacademy/">DevAcademy</a>, and I really appreciated the chance to learn about tools and ideas that I had not been exposed to yet from more experienced developers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Veteran participant, Alex Harder said he likes participating in ShipIt Day because he enjoys exploring new technologies and applying them to a problem. ShipIt Day continues to be successful among Cerner associates. Whether you want to work on something you don’t normally have time to, or you’re interested in meeting new people, ShipIt Day is a winner!</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/cerner-open-sources-its-kafka-utilities/"/>
    <updated>2018-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/cerner-open-sources-its-kafka-utilities</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Cerner, we often make use of many open source projects in our infrastructure. I work on a team responsible for Cerner&rsquo;s Ingestion Platform, a critical piece of infrastructure that takes in TBs of data and over a billion messages per day. The platform’s responsibility is then to make this data available for downstream teams to consume. When designing the Ingestion Platform, we felt Apache Kafka was perfect for ingesting and consuming these massive streams of data. We originally built the Ingestion Platform in 2014 and it has grown with Kafka ever since.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ve become experienced with Apache Kafka and how it works. We know how to monitor it, perform common administrative operations, and more. We’ve even made contributions to Kafka for various improvements [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3297">1</a>][<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4687">2</a>][<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2434">3</a>] and Apache Crunch, our processing framework, to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CRUNCH-606">add Kafka support</a>. We have also given <a href="https://www.confluent.io/resources/kafka-summit-2016/ingesting-complex-healthcare-data-apache-kafka/">talks</a> about our usage of Apache Kafka at Kafka Summit and we’ve written a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/11/how-cerner-uses-cdh-with-apache-kafka/">blog post</a> about it as well.</p>

<p>We are still interested in supporting the Kafka community, and today we hit another milestone as we open source some of our <a href="https://github.com/cerner/common-kafka">utilities for Kafka</a>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightweight wrappers over producer and consumer providing additional functionality</li>
<li>A client to simplify admin operations</li>
<li>A Kafka connect sink for delivering data to another Kafka cluster</li>
<li>Kafka test infrastructure for integration testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Try it and let me know what you think! You can log issues for improvements, or email me your thoughts: <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#98;&#x72;&#121;&#x61;&#110;&#x2e;&#98;&#x61;&#x75;&#103;&#104;&#x65;&#114;&#64;&#x63;&#101;&#114;&#x6e;&#x65;&#114;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;&#x2e;">&#x62;&#x72;&#121;&#97;&#110;&#x2e;&#98;&#x61;&#117;&#x67;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;&#64;&#99;&#101;&#x72;&#x6e;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#46;</a> We hope to continue to improve the library and always welcome contributions and ideas from others.</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/cerner-and-the-sdlc/"/>
    <updated>2018-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/cerner-and-the-sdlc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cerner has a very compelling story that many want to learn from. Cerner’s Agile Champions are regular presenters at local, national, and global conferences. We routinely host calls and site visits for interested companies around the world who want to figure out how we were able to adopt Agile so quickly and sustain it so successfully.</p>

<p>Despite our success, there has been a general feeling at the engineering leadership and Agile Champion tiers that we aren’t getting the benefits from Agile that we once were. We talk Agile well, but have far too many teams that could be classified as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/cargo-cult-agile-approach/">cargo cult</a>&rdquo; &ndash; going through the motions rather than having an Agile mindset. We were great teachers, but somehow had gone stagnant in our learning and growth.</p>

<p>Two events have ignited Cerner on a renewed learning journey that has already impacted Cerner in many business areas and allowed Cerner to help shape the future direction of business agility across the globe.</p>

<h3>The Invitation</h3>

<p>Ironically, the first came shortly after delivering a presentation at Agile 2014 that included a section on avoiding cargo cult Agile. <a href="https://twitter.com/asidky">Ahmed Sidky</a>, CEO of ICAgile, invited me to connect for a brief meeting. When our &ldquo;brief meeting&rdquo; stretched over several hours, we knew we had a strong partnership opportunity. Thus, was born the certification of Cerner’s Agile courses against an <a href="https://icagile.com/Overview">independent, internationally recognized curriculum</a> and Cerner as one of ICAgile’s first Member Organizations.</p>

<p>The second came shortly after Agile 2015 while hosting a call for CH Robinson and their delivery lead, <a href="https://twitter.com/jed2van">Vanessa Adams</a>. As the call wrapped up, Vanessa disclosed that she served on the board of directors for a newly formed group under the leadership of Steve Denning and Ahmed Sidky that was bringing together forward looking Agile companies to discover best practices in enterprise agility and share them back into the community. After talking with us, she felt that Cerner was an ideal candidate given our story and our willingness to learn and share.</p>

<p>I was intrigued yet skeptical.</p>

<p>I honestly didn’t know who <a href="https://twitter.com/stevedenning">Steve Denning</a> was so being a part of the &ldquo;Steve Denning Learning Consortium&rdquo; held no appeal. I respected Ahmed as a voice in the Agile community that understood how to address real business issues with an Agile mindset.</p>

<p>Some quick research on Steve exposed his background in the business and banking world. He is an author and regular contributor to Forbes magazine and Harvard Business Review. While he had written books on Agile management and was on the Scrum Alliance board, my mental image was of a business school professor, not a practicing agilist.</p>

<p>I voiced my concerns. Vanessa felt confident they would be resolved and invited us to attend an upcoming visit (May 2016) at Riot Games and Microsoft that would be partially hosted by Ahmed who had joined Riot Games as head of Delivery.</p>

<h3>Converting the Skeptic</h3>

<p>One of the keys to Cerner’s successful transformation was leveraging the idea of <em>Connectors</em>, <em>Mavens</em>, and <em>Salesmen</em> along with <em>Skeptics</em> as articulated by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1799410/connectors-mavens-and-salesmen-how-new-ideas-spread-seeds">Malcolm Gladwell</a> in our early pilot groups so we could address potential issues head on and build momentum. We were especially successful as some of the biggest <em>Skeptics</em> were also <em>Connectors</em> or <em>Mavens</em> and they have been crucial to our broad adoption and continued sustainability. Our results were our best <em>Salesmen</em>.</p>

<p>On Cerner’s first site visit to meet with the SD Learning Consortium, the roles played out again. <a href="http://www.sdlearningconsortium.org/who-we-are/">Microsoft, Riot Games, Ericsson, CH Robinson, Spotify</a>, Steve Denning, and a representative from the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum Alliance</a> were all in attendance. Over the four days in LA and Seattle, we got to see inside Riot and Microsoft and see what was working as well as what wasn’t. The open and frank conversations as well as the &ldquo;No BS&rdquo; attitude among all participants was extremely refreshing and productive.</p>

<p>At conferences, messages are polished and even &ldquo;learning&rdquo; (a.k.a. failure) is always painted in the best possible light. This was completely different. Failures that were failures were shared and discussed. Current experiments were both admired and challenged, often by the same individual.</p>

<p>Probably the most significant moment for me was sitting next to <a href="https://twitter.com/joakimsunden">Joakim Sunden</a> from Spotify, who co-authored what I still consider to be the best introductory book on Kanban for software development (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kanban-Action-Marcus-Hammarberg/dp/1617291056">Kanban in Action</a>), and having him explain how the Spotify videos were created and what really goes on. (Hint – they are Marketing videos and highlight models that Spotify does not rigidly follow. They don’t know what the Spotify Way is that many talk about.)  Spotify is great, visionary and different, but they aren’t a unicorn or perfect. A future site visit to Spotify solidified that fact and made me respect them even more.</p>

<p>I found that each existing member was a <em>Connector</em> in their organizations, a <em>Maven</em> in terms of enterprise agility, and a healthy <em>Skeptic</em> towards the bulk of commercialized Agile. Ahmed was the <em>Salesman</em>. Steve was a little bit of the professor, but clearly demonstrated an Agile mindset and a vision to change the world of work. I caught his vision. It was refreshing and for the first time in several years, I learned several new things that I could try at Cerner as soon as I got back. The <em>Skeptic</em> was converted.</p>

<h3>Assessing and Applying at Cerner</h3>

<p>As I took a hard look at Cerner after returning from the visit, I realized that our success with things like <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devcon/">DevCon</a> and the <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devacademy/">DevAcademy</a> where we were truly industry trend setters had allowed us to be complacent in other areas that the other SDLC members had as strengths. In some cases, entropy was setting in and some of the benefits we realized from going Agile were no longer as prevalent. We weren’t in the danger zone, but some trends were heading in the wrong direction and merited a fresh look.</p>

<p>In other cases, SDLC companies were branching out with experiments in areas like HR, Finance, or Marketing that were bearing fruit. Their success led to a desire to see what we could do at Cerner.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, site visits have been held at Microsoft (Seattle), Ericsson (Stolkholm and Athelone Ireland), Barclays Bank (London), BMW (Munich), Riot Games (LA), Spotify (New York), Vistaprint (Boston), Fidelity Investments (Boston), CH Robinson (Chicago), and Cerner. Without exception, from each set of site visits, at least three action items have been taken by the Cerner attendees to improve Cerner. There is a renewed vigor towards an Agile mindset that had waned over the past 3-4 years.
At the beginning, Shahzad Zafar and I were the only representatives for Cerner. Now we have four Cerner associates at each site visit and have many other associates engage in deep dive conversations on special topics like DevOps, Shadow IT, or HR.</p>

<h3>Learning and Sharing</h3>

<p>Part of the SDLC is to learn from each other and then share those messages back into the broader community. There is deep, rich learning that can be gained from blending large companies like Ericcson with over 100K employees with a mid-tier company like Cerner (20K+), smaller companies like Vistaprint (5k+) and &ldquo;born Agile&rdquo; start-ups like Riot Games.</p>

<p>While each SDLC member has software components as part of the services that we offer to our clients, we operate in different verticals. The lessons we learn are universal and are not limited to a specific market or niche.</p>

<p>At the end of 2016, the SDLC members got together and <a href="http://www.sdlearningconsortium.org/what-we-have-learned/">summarized our learnings</a> from the year in a paper that Steve then presented at the 2016 Drucker Forum.</p>

<p>Personally, I have gone from the Skeptic to a very vocal evangelist, sharing the combined Cerner and SDLC story at the 2016 KC PMI Conference, <a href="http://2016.leanagilekc.com/sessions/the-future-is-here/">2016 LeanAgileKC</a>, 2017 Business Agility Conference, Agile 2017, 2017 Global PMI PMO Symposium as well as 2 of Cerner’s 2017 DevCons. Barclays Bank and Riot Games have been equally as active in sharing the SDLC learnings across the globe.</p>

<p>Steve Denning recently published an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2017/10/15/what-is-agile-the-four-essential-elements/#24b8c3736e85">article in Forbes</a> with the findings that are starting to be cited as the core fundamentals for business agility across the globe with Cerner listed as a prevalent contributor.</p>

<p>Like the Agile Manifesto, the principles are simple, yet powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delighting Customers</li>
<li>Descaling Work</li>
<li>Enterprise-wide Agility</li>
<li>Nurture Culture</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>The SDLC is currently viewed as the leader in business agility practices and is shaping the speakers and agendas for the <a href="http://businessagilityconf.com/">Business Agility Conferences</a> globally. We continue to expand membership to include new companies who meet the criteria of a leader in agility and have a story to tell. Current members have grown to include Barclays Bank, Vistaprint, Fidelity Investments, Target, American Express, and All State are all candidates to join in 2018.</p>

<p>The brightest future is not about the SDLC but about Cerner and what we can accomplish based on learning from other SDLC members. Our 2018 Vision aligns well with the SDLC learnings and several strategies to achieve our vision include models based on what other SDLC members have already proven to be successful.</p>

    <updated>2018-01-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/bad-design-is-bad-for-your-health-why-data-visualization-details-matter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Presentation Abstract by Jody Butts, Sr. User Experience Designer
Given on August 11, 2017 at the UX Australia Conference in Sydney</p>

<p><em>Full presentation audio and slides are available here:</em> <a href="http://www.uxaustralia.com.au/conferences/uxaustralia-2017/presentation/bad-design-is-bad-for-your-health-why-data-visualization-details-matter/">http://www.uxaustralia.com.au/conferences/uxaustralia-2017/presentation/bad-design-is-bad-for-your-health-why-data-visualization-details-matter/</a></p>

<p>The proper design of data visualization details is imperative for accurate and actionable data visualizations and dashboards. In the health care technology industry, even the smallest design detail on a graph of patient data can have a dramatic impact on patient safety and outcomes. For example, auto-adjusting y-axes in vitals graphs across patient charts in the EMR could cause change blindness which impacts the perception of patient data trends.</p>

<h2>Patient Safety</h2>

<p>As a user experience designer for Cerner, a health care IT company, patient safety is the foundation of my work. However, we see startling patient safety statistics around the world today. According to a Johns Hopkins <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/">study</a> from 2016, medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States, following heart disease and cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/patient_safety/en/">estimates</a> that in developed countries across the globe, as many as one in ten patients are harmed while receiving hospital care.</p>

<p>Based on research the User Experience team at Cerner has done, there are several challenges the health care industry faces to ensure patient safety. From workflow and communication to external rules and regulation, there is a complex and interconnected web of factors.</p>

<p>While human error is unavoidable, there should be several defensive layers for every system. Despite the training, regulation, and process our health systems have, health care providers are still working in high-risk environments.</p>

<p>Understaffed health systems are flooded by people in need of care. On a bustling hospital floor with alarms going off at all hours, care team members running between patient rooms, and the need to use a computer to document patient data to meet government regulations, it is no wonder that medical error occurs.</p>

<p>Although we cannot ensure software will always work perfectly, we do have responsibility to ensure that the UI and UX layers of our systems are designed to protect our users and enable them to perform their tasks well.</p>

<h2>User Experience at Cerner</h2>

<p>I work for Cerner, a company at the intersection of health care and IT. Cerner technologies support the full continuum of care including clinical, financial, and patient engagement solutions. We have products licensed at more than 25,000 facilities across 35 countries.</p>

<p>As a part of Cerner’s UX team, I spend most of my time designing in the clinical space, working on projects for our main product: the electronic medical record (EMR), mainly used by doctors and nurses. Our technology is subject to a long list of legislation and regulations. Cerner has an entire team dedicated to reviewing standards for each country to ensure we are meeting all health IT requirements.</p>

<p>Our UX team also has training on how these standards impact our designs and research. Accessibility guidelines, patient privacy, and medication safety are just a few examples of regulation themes that guide our work. I focus on the rules that impact data visualizations and incorporate additional research to create safe and usable experiences.</p>

<p>The accurate graphical display of patient data has become my passion over the past two and a half years. Data visualization is a very powerful tool across industries, but I’m biased toward believing that its most amazing applications are in health care technology.</p>

<h2>Data Visualization in Pediatric Health Care</h2>

<p>For many years, the EMR was simply an input tool for charting patient data–most data review was solely displayed in rows and columns. Now we are creating meaningful displays of information for clinicians to support their decisions.</p>

<p>For example, the pediatric growth chart has been used by health care providers to track children’s growth from birth into adulthood for almost 40 years, starting on paper. The WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have standards for healthy growth of height, weight, head circumference and more based on age, sex, and so on.</p>

<p>These standards are displayed as percentile lines that create a unique curve for each measure. When patient data is plotted, it becomes easy to identify if a child’s growth is progressing normally, or if there are abnormal patterns. For the first 20 years of an individual’s life, the growth chart is essential for tracking healthy growth progression. It is also an invaluable tool for communication between parents and clinicians.</p>

<p>As I have worked on a redesign of Cerner’s interactive growth chart tools, I have had the opportunity to observe clinicians using the growth chart in hospitals. In a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) setting, or neonatal intensive care unit, physicians are making life-saving decisions for premature infants based on this information. For specialists, such as pediatric endocrinologists, the pattern of the trend line is often the first indication of diagnoses such as hypothyroidism. Can you imagine being able to recognize a disease by looking at a line graph?</p>

<h2>Data Visualization Design Details</h2>

<p>In a matter of clicks, we can take tables with thousands of numbers and transform them into graphics that provide immediate insights. From problem solving to storytelling, this information drives action across every industry.</p>

<p>There are countless examples of confusing and even misleading graphs–just try a Google search for “bad data visualizations,” and you’ll see what I mean. This assumed legitimacy is dangerous, especially when the design is sleek and appears trustworthy. The details that lead to accurate and impactful data visualizations fall into three categories: clarity, context, and creativity.</p>

<p>Clarity</p>

<p>Clarity is the foundation of data visualization design. We want to avoid all potential for confusion in order to empower our users to confidently make decisions. To achieve this, we must start with the basics. The title of a visualization should be succinct, yet provide the information needed to understand what data are being viewed and how they are being measured. If additional details are important to include, consider using supporting text below the title.</p>

<p>A dangerous mistake I regularly see while consulting on visualizations and dashboards is improper or missing labels. Do not make users guess what data points are being shown or how they are being measured. All axes in visualizations should be labeled. It is also important to include the unit of measure, which I like to include in parentheses next to the label. </p>

<p>While labels are important, I believe the most powerful element for clear data visualizations is proper scale. A simple mistake I often see is to start the y-axis of a bar graph at a value other than 0. Human eyes interpret the value of a bar to be equal to its length, so when the y-axis does not begin at 0, the values are not interpreted accurately. Similarly, the perception of data measured in percentages is also often skewed by scale. This sometimes occurs because a tool automatically adjusts the scale to fit to the data, but sometimes it is done to manipulate the data display. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E91bGT9BjYk&amp;t=40s">example</a> of an ad from Chevy illustrates the power scale has on perception (starting at 0:45).</p>

<p>Context</p>

<p>Once there is a truthful and clear foundation for data, the following techniques can bring users quicker insights and increase their confidence in data interpretation.</p>

<p>If there is a normal, expected, or ideal range of values for the data, adding a target range is a simple but powerful way to add context. A light shaded region behind the grid lines can allow users to easily identify high and low values. Similar to a target range, a goal line can be added to indicate a discrete value that the plotted data should be achieving. A goal line and target range can be used together as well.</p>

<p>It’s important to mark visualizations and dashboards with the date it was published. I also recommend including the date or date range of the data as well in order to maintain trust and relevancy of your visualization.</p>

<p>Annotations are another simple way to provide your user with context. On-canvas notes and labels should be used sparingly, but can help highlight insights. These can be placed in context of a specific data point, a date or timeframe, etc.</p>

<p>Creativity</p>

<p>Once we have created a clear visualization and provided our user with additional context, we are ready to polish our design. There is great potential for creativity in data visualization, but it can cause more harm than good if done poorly. Let’s look at visual encoding methods, colors, and other visual design details that can enhance your visualization or dashboard.</p>

<p>Qualitative and quantitative data is visually encoded, or translated, through a variety of graphical methods that make up each visualization type. <a href="https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2015_spring/inls541_001/Readings/Cleveland%20and%20McGill%201985%20-%20Graphical%20Perception%20and%20Cleveland1985-Graphical%20Methods%20for%20Analyzing%20Scientific%20Data.pdf">Research</a> has been done on these visual encoding methods, giving us insights for human graphical perception. Statistician William Cleveland and his colleague, Robert McGill, tested the visual encoding methods and ranked them by accuracy of perception. Their findings give us a scientific foundation for data visualization.</p>

<p>Position is the best encoding method for accuracy, followed by length, angle, area, volume, and finally, with color taking the last spot. This means that color is not reliable for communicating data information in a graph. This aligns to the WCAG 2.0 accessibility <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-without-color">guidelines</a>, which state that color cannot be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, and so on. Second, bar, and line graphs are common for good reason–they are most effective for our brains to accurately understand. Ultimately, it’s always best to try a couple of options and compare their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Use color sparingly. Think of it as a tool for drawing attention to the most important insights. If everything has color, especially on a dashboard, nothing will stand out. Since approximately 10% of the population is color blind, we should avoid using red and green together on a visualization. <a href="http://colororacle.org/">Color Oracle</a> is a great color blindness simulator that you can use to see how your colors appear for users with these vision deficiencies.</p>

<p>Ensure you maintain high contrast between colors by avoiding very light or very dark shades. The <a href="http://colormine.org/delta-e-calculator/">Delta-E calculation</a> measures the distance between two colors. At Cerner, we ensure a difference of at least 3.5.</p>

<p>The best way to test the colors you are using is to print it out in grayscale. Make sure you can still match plotted data to its labels. Better yet, get additional eyes on it. This test ensures that color is not being utilized as the only way to communicate meaning.</p>

<h2>Visualizations are the Key to Understanding Data</h2>

<p>The world is overflowing with big, complex problems, but we also have big, complex data to solve them. This big, complex data exists as numbers that can go on forever. Data visualizations are the key for humans to understand it all. Data must be visualized clearly and effectively to enable professionals across industries to understand it, make decisions, and take action based on it.</p>

<p>We can revolutionize health care and other fields through the way we visualize data. The design details matter. Through clear, contextual, and creative data visualizations, we can drive action that will change the world and even save lives.</p>

    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/2-to-the-5th-coding-competition-2017</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Competition</h2>

<p>Part of Cerner&rsquo;s engineering culture is to celebrate technology. This past fall, we had our annual celebration for <a href="https://twitter.com/CernerEng/status/908047795768217600">Programmers’ Day</a>. We celebrated the day with great food (taco bar and ice cream) and an evening of trivia.</p>

</td>

</table>


<p>With our celebrations, we also like to blend in challenges or activities that can mold desired behaviors. Therefore, as part of Programmers&#8217; Day, we also kicked off a programming competition (our third year of organizing the competition). For 32 days (September 13 &ndash; October 16), associates submitted small snippets of code (32 lines or less) in any language that represented the concept of engineering impact. After 32 days, our panel of judges sorted through the code and assigned a winner to each of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best Representation</strong>:  What captures the concept of &ldquo;engineering impact&rdquo; the best?</li>
<li><strong>Most Obfuscated</strong>: Which code snippet was the most difficult to understand?</li>
<li><strong>Greatest Variety in Languages</strong>:  Which repository contains the most variety in programming languages across submissions?</li>
<li><strong>Most First Hand Submissions</strong>: Which participant submitted the most code that relates to <a href="https://www.firsthandfoundation.org/">First Hand Foundation</a> and its mission to &ldquo;impact&rdquo; others?</li>
</ul>


<p>As with anywhere, engineers at Cerner are busy. Asking them to do something additional, like a coding competition, imposes challenges on participation based on their availability of time. However, we found that by organizing the competition for engineers to explore and share what they are working on, in small and consumable bites of code, helped in keeping it a simple time investment and gained participation. Furthermore, it helped reinforce a routine behavior to continually look and evaluate different technologies and languages.</p>

<p>Just like tweets, by having small code examples being shared, it was easy for others to also learn what they were doing. We facilitated sharing these tweets by making a dashboard which served up crawled results from GitHub. This was achieved by having participants including a specific phase in their code (like a hashtag), which could then be pulled from GitHub’s search and built into a dashboard. This dashboard was based on how we originally achieved this in our earlier <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/the-30-days-of-code-experiment/">30 Days of Code competition</a>.</p>

<h2>The Winners</h2>

<p>Our winners from this year are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best Representation</strong>:  <a href="https://github.com/AnEmortalKid/such-interview">Jan Monterrubio</a></li>
<li><strong>Most Obfuscated</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/dbailey31/Cerner">Douglas Bailey</a> <em>(Honorable mention: <a href="https://github.com/joehuck/bash_projects">Joe Huck</a>)</em></li>
<li><strong>Greatest Variety in Languages</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/afrin216/2to5">Afrin Subair</a></li>
<li><strong>Most First Hand Submissions</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/jvarness/cerner-2-to-the-5th">Jake Varness</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Congratulations to the winners and thank you to everyone who submitted code. Until next year!</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/announcing-bunsen-fhir-data-with-apache-spark/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/announcing-bunsen-fhir-data-with-apache-spark</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re excited to open source <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/bunsen">Bunsen</a>, a library to make analyzing <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html">FHIR data</a> with <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> simple and scalable. Bunsen encodes FHIR resources directly into Apache Spark&rsquo;s native data structures. This lets users leverage well-defined FHIR data models directly within Spark SQL.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple query against a table of FHIR observations that produces a table of
heart rate values:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">spark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">select subject.reference person_id,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">       effectiveDateTime date_time,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">       valueQuantity.value value</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">from observations</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">where in_valueset(code, &#39;heart_rate&#39;)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s"> &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">show</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which prints a table like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th align="left">person_id        </th>
<th align="left">date_time    </th>
<th align="left">value   </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left">Patient/123      </td>
<td align="left">2016-12-27   </td>
<td align="left">54.0000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left">Patient/123      </td>
<td align="left">2017-04-18   </td>
<td align="left">60.0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Notice that each field in the above SQL is fully defined by the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/observation.html">FHIR Observation model</a>. This is because the table schemas are generated directly from FHIR resource definitions, ensuring these queries exactly match other FHIR-based views of the same data.</p>

<p>Bunsen also provides a collection of helpful functions to make querying data easy. The above query includes the <em>in_valueset</em> user-defined function, allowing users to use code value sets directly in the query. You can see the <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/bunsen/introduction.html#bring-your-own-value-sets">Bunsen value set documentation</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Scalability and Performance</h3>

<p>Because Bunsen encodes FHIR resources in Apache Spark&rsquo;s efficient binary format, we get all of Spark&rsquo;s scalability and performance advantages. Simple queries across billions of FHIR resources typically return in single-digit seconds in internal clusters. Arbitrary joins and aggregations of complex datasets scale with your Apache Spark cluster. We take advantage of Spark&rsquo;s built-in support for <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> to read and write FHIR with an efficient columnar data format that is readable by other systems as well.</p>

<h3>Sophisticated Queries</h3>

<p>Spark SQL offers rich query semantics that can now be used directly over FHIR data models. For instance,
here is a query that builds a timeseries-like table directly from a collection of observations by simply
grouping items by the person and time period. This is just standard Spark SQL wrapped around
our simple valueset-based function.</p>

<p>Typical queries may aggregate many other types of data and join to conditions, allergies, or other tables
to build a more complete report. All of this can be done interactively over billions of records.</p>

<h3>Java Usage</h3>

<p>Bunsen uses the <a href="http://hapifhir.io/">HAPI FHIR</a> library to represent data in object form. Java users can convert their objects from the HAPI to Spark-native structures and back with a few lines of code. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/celebrating-world-usability-day-at-cerner</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>World Usability Day is celebrated worldwide on the second Thursday in November every year. Across the globe, organizations host events and use this day to provide education on how to make products easier to use and simpler to access, as well as to celebrate progress in this pursuit.</p>

<p>The World Usability Day theme for 2017 was &ldquo;Inclusion.&rdquo; Inclusive design considers the range of abilities, language and other forms of human difference when creating a solution. Designing with these in mind from the start can create a better suited product for everyone.</p>

<p>Cerner&rsquo;s Kansas City-based User Experience (UX) team celebrated by hosting a day filled with five speaker sessions and an afternoon workshop for Cerner associates on November 9, in the Innovations Campus event space. Following the theme, the speakers covered topics such as accessibility and universal design.</p>

<p>Lauren Bock, User Experience Designer on the UX team, kicked off the day with a presentation on <em>Universal Design: The Equality of Experience</em>. Lauren explained how designing only for the &ldquo;average user,&rdquo; or including only the minimum accessibility requirements, can result in something designed for no one. We each have unique needs and designing products, services and experiences designed in a way that honors those needs can result in a better outcome for everyone. She shared how designing universally from the beginning not only makes a better product, but does so for a larger number of users.</p>

<p>Following the keynote, Dr. Ben Wilkerson, Physician Executive for Cerner&rsquo;s Population Health organization, shared his take on why <em>Healthcare Software is Failing at the Box Office</em>. In his talk, Dr. Wilkerson drew comparisons between healthcare software and the movie industry. He highlighted how healthcare software can take cues from films in the way that production teams spend the majority of time in research, preparation, and planning, before the costly filming step. Dr. Wilkerson also compared the different roles of the production team to those designing software at Cerner and how they can work together to create a compelling result.</p>

<p>In the last session for the morning, Scott Wilmarth, Senior User Experience Designer on the UX team, shared his personal and real-world story on the importance of accessibility in <em>Retinas, Accessibility, and More Stuff I Learned About on the Way to Get Thai Food</em>. After an unexpected loss of vision in one of his eyes, Scott has become an accessibility advocate, sharing his story with development teams, Cerner Health Conference attendees and others at Cerner. Scott shared the impact of accessibility and shared ways for designers, developers and project teams at Cerner to integrate accessibility into their processes. He explained that designing for accessibility is not just required, but the right thing to do. Accounting for different abilities in design can ultimately create better products for all users.</p>

<p>After lunch, Michael Turman, the Senior Strategist for the Reference Data Management team, gave his perspective on why <em>We&rsquo;re Going to Need a Bigger Boat</em> when designing our solutions at Cerner. Coming from the Cerner Consulting organization, Michael highlighted the importance of the post-development, implementation and maintenance steps of Cerner software with our clients. He provided tips for teams to design for these user bases and with implementation in mind. He explained that by designing for users both upstream and downstream in the development process we can create better experiences.</p>

<p>Dr. Jeff Wall, Director of the Physician Strategy and Medical Specialties organization, concluded the speaking sessions with his talk <em>Designing the Physician Workflow: Technical vs. Adaptive considerations for success</em>. Dr. Wall summarized it perfectly, &ldquo;change is hard.&rdquo; How do we help users effectively handle change as we constantly improve our healthcare software? He explained that when designing software for our users, we must be considerate of adaptive challenges, making sure to distinguish between technical changes and changes to human behavior. With years of experience as a clinician, Dr. Wall explained methods for Cerner teams to prepare for and introduce change to our users.</p>

<p>The last activity for the day was a Virtual Reality Workshop sponsored by the Cerner Labs team, who focus on the investigation of emerging technologies and how to use those to create new ways of engaging with data. Workshop participants were able to experience a scenario using Virtual Reality (VR) headsets. Small groups led by UX team members replayed the scenario and used the technique of Journey Mapping to lay out the course of the experience, ultimately discovering areas of opportunity for improvement for the scenario. Groups reconvened and shared each of their maps to learn from each other.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-11-14-celebrating-world-usability-day-at-cerner/ux-vr.jpg"></p>

<p>The day concluded with a public evening meet-up hosted in partnership with the User Experience Professionals Association of Kansas City, a local non-profit organization focused on UX. Attendees were invited to tour the User Experience Lab where the Human Factors Research team conducts usability tests and other research studies. This tour was followed by a design challenge where attendees broke out into teams and collaborated on creating quick solutions to design prompts focused on inclusive design.</p>

<p>Just around the corner from the User Experience Lab at the Innovations campus is a hand-drawn installation of epic proportion about World Usability Day. These 20 ft. long, 10 ft. tall installations of content are created and drawn by UX team members, and will rotate every quarter. Located next to the glass wall is an interactive puzzle also put together by the UX team, highlighting User Experience Vice President, Paul Weaver’s definition of UX: &ldquo;UX is the nexus between the user and the machine; a combination of design and research that works to perfect human-computer interaction.&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/accessibility-and-usability-on-the-road-to-great-ux/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/accessibility-and-usability-on-the-road-to-great-ux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, a group of designers from Columbus, Ohio set out to create a grassroots, cross-discipline, and creative conference. Since that first event, Midwest UX has been an ongoing tradition that attracts innovative ideas and provides an opportunity for regional professions to engage in discussion with other professionals. Last year, Amber Wilks and Dr. Becca Green were invited to take their talk from DevCon 2016 on the road to Midwest UX. On October 20, 2016, they presented Accessibility &amp; Usability: The Equality of Experience in Louisville, KY.</p>

<p>At Midwest UX, the talk covered all of the great content from DevCon enhanced by examples of how accessibility specifically affects our solutions used by our consumer market or clinical staff. Each point covered demonstrated how UX and development work together to achieve an accessible software solution and the importance of crafting equally awesome experiences for all of our users. When people talk about accessibility, there are some common myths that go along with the topic. So the talks starts off by covering three myths of accessibility that have impacted the health care community, and Cerner in particular.</p>

<p>The first myth covered was that project teams look at accessibility as a minefield they must cross to achieve accessible software. The truth is that it is simply a blend of legislation and regulation that aims to eliminate barriers in technology for people with disabilities. In fact there are two main forms of standards used in the U.S. to define accessible content, Section 508 and W3&rsquo;s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. While they serve similar purposes, there are some very key differences. They different in terms of the technology they cover, the organization of the guidelines, and their application. However, they are just a small part of a landscape of legislation and regulation that make up accessibility.</p>

<p>The second myth covered the assumption that accessibility is all about screen readers and alt tags. In reality, screen readers are just a small subset of assistive technologies. Low-vision or blind users only make up a small slice of all U.S. citizens with disabilities. There are a variety of assistive technologies to aid every type of disability. The third and final myth we covered is specific to the healthcare industry; that clinicians aren&rsquo;t disabled so accessibility isn&rsquo;t a priority for our users. The truth is that clinicians are not immune to disabilities. In fact, a study in the British Journal of General Practice that found that the proportion of male doctors with color vision deficiency was at 8%, in line with the percentage of the general population.</p>

<p>As the guidelines for accessibility have evolved, so has the organization of these guidelines such that they can now be organized into 4 tenant principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>

<h3>Perceivable</h3>

<p>Information and UI components must be presented in ways users can perceive. In other words, information can&rsquo;t be invisible. We do that by making information distinguishable and by providing alternative forms of content.</p>

<p>To make information distinguishable, the foundations involve color math and text zoom. To create distinguishable information using color there are two mathematical calculations that can be used to ensure the content is both legible and discernible. To ensure the content is legible, Cerner follows WCAG&rsquo;s (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) color contrast guidelines include Guideline 1.4.3, which states that &ldquo;the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ration of at least 4.5:1.&rdquo; To check if your information is legible, the WCAG recommends using the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker. This tool simply requires that you enter in your text, or foreground, color and background color and it will tell you to what degree you meet the contrast guidelines.</p>

<p>The second calculation ensures users can perceive changes in the content. While this calculation is not part of accessibility guidelines, we leverage the calculation as a baseline metric for interaction indications (i.e., hovers, click states, icons, etc.). This numerical value starts at 0 and the higher the number, the greater the difference between two colors. We recommend a minimum value of 3.5, which represents an obvious difference.</p>

<p>The other part of having distinguishable content is allowing for text zooming. In the U.S. alone, 8.1 million people have a vision disability. In March 2013, WebAIM conducted a survey of users with low vision, which found that the bulk of accessible technologies used by these individuals included some form of text resizing. Text zooming is a method used to scale text up and down while retaining the screen formatting and layout. A successful text zoom is when the content can be resized up to 200% and everything on the screen scales uniformly and scroll bars are provided if needed.</p>

<p>The second part of providing perceivable content is to provide content that supports all the senses. A video may require a paired audio supplement. An audio file may require a written transcript. Just like the transcript we provided with our talk. While people with vision disabilities are a small slice of the population, those with hearing disabilities make up a larger portion and are more likely to be employed. So it&rsquo;s far more likely that a user would need supplemental text than they would be using a screen reader.</p>

<p>One of the most common ways to provide alternative content is through captioning. Captioning is the transcription of speech and important sound effects. Not to be confused with subtitling which is a written translation of dialogue.</p>

<h3>Operable</h3>

<p>UI components and navigation must be operable. In other words, the UI cannot require an interaction that a user cannot perform. Most assistive technologies used by people with disabilities emulate how a keyboard functions. So a good rule of thumb is that if it can be navigated with a keyboard, then it is accessible. Operability is about giving the user control with controls to pause, stop, and hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content.</p>

<h3>Understandable</h3>

<p>Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. In other words, the content and operation cannot be beyond a user&rsquo;s understanding. Users consume content in a variety of ways and we must be flexible to accommodate all of the different ways they might access information. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that content is housed in a structured framework to facilitate navigation.</p>

<p>As part of the talk, an example of the experience a screen reader user might have while navigating a well known and popular website is presented. This set of videos demonstrates some of the common problems found with navigation such as duplicate links, ambiguous link names, and long navigation. The results of an automated accessibility tool are presented to highlight that not only are automated tools important for assessing accessibility but that it also requires a manual component.</p>

<h3>Robust</h3>

<p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide range of user agents. In other words, user must be able to access the content as technologies advance. Since there are a lot of different types of assistive technology, as these technologies change, so does the landscape of accessibility. Being future friendly isn&rsquo;t as hard as keeping up with technology. It&rsquo;s actually as easy as sticking to &ldquo;the basics.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Write valid code</li>
<li>Optimize navigation</li>
<li>Stick to standards</li>
<li>Stay away from known hazards</li>
</ul>


<p>The key to crafting equally compelling experiences for all is the concept of Universal Design. Universal design is the design and composition of buildings, products, and services so they can be accessed, understood, and used by all people. It&rsquo;s an inclusive approach to design. When you design for the average person, you&rsquo;re actually designing for no one. We are each unique and have different needs. We want to encourage you to not think of accessibility as a flat, one-size-fits-all solution but instead as a multifaceted, configurable space. It&rsquo;s more than just what&rsquo;s on the screen though. It&rsquo;s about the environment and the users in that environment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Introducing Jwala, a Resource Manager for the Apache Community</h3>

<p><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> and <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd</a> are hardened, scalable, and reliable open-source solutions. Widely adopted, these solutions are commonly used to host and load-balance Java applications.</p>

<p>Configuring and managing a small set of elements is relatively easy, but once you start scaling out your application and platform, things get complicated. Questions such as &ldquo;How do I update the heap or database pool-size across hundreds of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)?&rdquo; arise. Although commercial solutions exist to solve this and other similar problems, an open-source solution was not available &ndash; until now.</p>

<p>Originally designed and developed to accommodate Cerner&rsquo;s complex topologies, Jwala was developed to automate deploying our web applications here at Cerner. Now Cerner is donating Jwala as open source. Making contributions to development communities is an important part of Cerner&rsquo;s engineering culture. We love it when we&rsquo;re able to give back to the community, and we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll love Jwala!</p>

<p>A Cerner platform based on Apache Tomcat and Apache httpd, Jwala enables the configuration, deployment, and management of logical groups of Tomcat JVMs load-balanced by Apache web servers.</p>

<p>With Jwala you can configure, deploy, and manage your large-scale Tomcat and Apache httpd topology at an enterprise scale. You can create and persist definitions of Group instances that include web applications, JVMs, web servers, and other resources, and expose them through a RESTful interface, Jwala&rsquo;s REST API, to perform management operations on the group.</p>

<p>Jwala utilizes a defined file system structure and Secure Shell (SSH) agents on each machine to manage running Tomcat instances on remote servers. Jwala&rsquo;s application deployment model knows how to request current status from each Tomcat and httpd instance. Jwala also is able to update each instance as changes are made to the configuration and allows maintenance operations to be executed from a central console. Last but not least, Jwala maintains an audit log of all the operations or changes performed on any of its managed resources.</p>

<p>So, if you are someone in development, operations, or management looking for an easier way to configure and manage a large Tomcat topology, <a href="https://github.com/cerner/jwala">check out Jwala</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/engineers-on-the-road-for-smart-and-fhir/">previous post</a>, we discussed the need to provide education around our ecosystem and implementation of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/overview-dev.html">FHIRⓇ</a> and <a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/">SMARTⓇ</a> standards for developers and how we did so at our annual Cerner Health Conference. That same week, we were also a part of <a href="http://www.fhirdevdays.com/">FHIR DevDays</a>, which included a track entitled &ldquo;Apps in the EHR.&rdquo; We worked alongside track participants who were seeking to integrate their apps in a variety of EHRs, including Cerner.</p>

<p>FHIR DevDays is a conference put on by <a href="http://fhir.furore.com/">Furore</a> in Amsterdam. This year, over 250 participants from all over the world gathered to attend tutorials given by FHIR community leaders in the mornings and participate in hands-on sessions in the afternoons.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-09-21-engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir/Devdays_2016.jpg"></p>

<p>Cerner co-led the &ldquo;Apps in the EHR&rdquo; track. This track was comprised of roughly 20 people from across France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshCMandel">Josh Mandel</a> kicked things off with a tutorial on <a href="http://smarthealthit.org/">SMART</a> and how to <a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/">get started</a> building cross-vendor applications. Afterward, we met with track participants to show them how to get plugged into Cerner&rsquo;s sandbox and ecosystem. We started out by covering our <a href="https://code.cerner.com/">documentation launchpoint</a>, registering applications in our <a href="https://code.cerner.com/developer/smart-on-fhir">code console</a>, and going over our <a href="http://fhir.cerner.com/">technical documentation</a>. For those who didn&rsquo;t come to the conference with an existing application to work on, we provided a <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/smart-on-fhir-tutorial">tutorial</a>. With those tools in hand, they were ready to get to work!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-09-21-engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir/hands-on.jpg"></p>

<br />


<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-09-21-engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir/hands-on2.png"></p>

<p>Over the course of the three afternoons, we assisted people as they used SMART and FHIR for the first time, but also people with experience in FHIR who were looking to get their technical and business questions answered about integrating with Cerner.
Several of the projects were plugged into multiple sandboxes. The developers shared that once their app was working in one sandbox, it was easy to plug into others, which is exactly how it should be!</p>

<p>When we gave our closing presentation, we actually had some technical difficulties loading up the slides. Little did we know that <a href="https://twitter.com/grahamegrieve">Grahame Grieve</a>, the original architect of FHIR, snapped a picture and would use it shortly in his <a href="https://vimeo.com/192190127">closing keynote</a> on FHIR’s future.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-09-21-engineers-overseas-for-smart-and-fhir/closing-keynote.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fhir_furore/status/799626324927053824">With this image on screen</a>, he stated: &ldquo;[to us:] Well done. [to the rest of the audience:] Next time somebody in your acquaintance tells you that certain vendors aren&rsquo;t invested in interoperability, I want you to think about this. That&rsquo;s part of what the FHIR community is about, alright? Cerner and Epic on the stage together. It&rsquo;s not special anymore, even. It&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>FHIR DevDays is Europe&rsquo;s biggest FHIR conference and many attendees don&rsquo;t typically make it to the tri-annual HL7 Working Group Meetings that focus on the formation and evolution of the specification. We were pleased to be a part of that gathering and to work alongside people interested in engaging with Cerner. But, we were also encouraged by the comments Grahame and others gave as they expressed appreciation that Cerner would be present and show our interest and dedication to the standard. We look forward to being back at DevDays 2017 this November to lead tracks on SMART &amp; FHIR and CDS Hooks.</p>

<p>There is no better way to end summer than with ShipIt Day! We kicked off our ninth ShipIt Day on August 10th, with more than 75 Cerner associates signed up. Nineteen different teams worked for 24 hours straight to complete their projects. For those unfamiliar with the event, ShipIt Day is a 24 hour hackathon for internal associates to create something innovative, usable, and value-adding. This was the second ShipIt held at our new <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2017/02/10/get-a-sneak-peek-inside-cerner-s-new-innovations.html">Innovations Campus</a>. Associates love using our new campus for ShipIt because of the game rooms and collaboration spaces! One new addition to this quarter’s ShipIt Day was the scavenger hunt. Participants were given a list of crazy tasks to accomplish within the 24 hours. Some tasks included spoon feeding a fellow team member, completing the obstacle courses around the outdoor walking trail, and finding binary codes around campus and decoding them. Shoutout to the winners of the scavenger hunt: the Jumpy Woodchucks team!</p>

<h3>Team Bravo Avocado</h3>

<p>ShipIt Day IX teams brought their A game. The projects get more intricate and more impressive each time around. ShipIt Day is a great way to show off the talent we have at Cerner. Team Bravo Avocado, made up of Thomas Clay, Jacob Zimmerman, Jan Monterrubio, Max Schroeder, and Elisha Boozer took first place! Judges were impressed by their live demo and humorous presentation style.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our project was an enhancement for Millennium Java services that removes certain required pieces of server implementation by adding custom annotations. Consumers will no longer have the same restrictions from traditional service generation (i.e. defining a generation file, method naming), because the annotation processor will generate that for them. Also, the framework can bind the structured request/reply objects to an annotated object of their choice. These annotations remove lots of redundant code and gives consumers more time to focus on what matters.</p></blockquote>

</div>


<h3>Team E=MC Hammer</h3>

<p>Second place went to team E=MC Hammer, made up of Kyle Lipke, Nimesh Subramanian, James Boyd, Mahesh Sampekatte, and Megan McConnell.</p>

<blockquote><p>For ShipIt IX, our team E=MC Hammer built a tool that looks up and publishes Millennium OAuth keys. This tool was created to be an easy-to-use, easy-to-search, and updateable source of truth for all those that request and use Millennium OAuth keys. We set up an api that hosts only the data we wish to present, in a read-only &ldquo;MAP&rdquo; so users understand the structure of the data. We had a blast on the project and would recommend attending a ShipIt day yourself!</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Greg Whitsitt noted that their project was:</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;applicable across teams, solves a problem many face. A great idea and great execution.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Team Jumpy Woodchucks</h3>

<p>Team Jumpy Woodchucks, made up of Hans Perera, Nathaniel Owen, Ann Dickey, James Thomas, and Pramoth Murali took third place. Their project was Chamberlain:</p>

<blockquote><p>Light notification system for all your notification needs that decorates your desk. This system currently supports alerts for Microsoft Outlook, Crucible, and Millennium domain health. Designed to be highly customizable and a project for teams to learn about electronics and use of Makerspace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Judges commented that this project was what the heart of ShipIt Day is all about.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Each ShipIt Day, we see a handful of ShipIt &ldquo;veterans.&rdquo; It is always interesting to hear our associates take on the 24 hour event. Ian Kottman, a software engineer on the Population Health Genomics team, has a lot to say about his experience participating in ShipIt Day.</p>

<blockquote><p>I recently got to take part in one of my favorite events at Cerner: ShipIt Day. This was my fourth ShipIt and I was excited about the project my team had come up with. My team had named ourselves 🌝, which is one of the team member&rsquo;s favorite emoji. We planned to add a UI to a tool we created last ShipIt to manage access to Cerner&rsquo;s Makerspace. Our primary goal this time around was to have fun and win the coveted cheeseballs.</p>

<p>In the short 24 hours we had our team went through all of the stages of a typical software project: design, implementation, realization we overestimated, shedding unneeded features, and finally getting something working. Partway through the day we ran into issues getting Chrome to run in a Docker container and there was a brief incident involving internationalization breaking our error page, but after many whiteboard sessions and late night sodas we completed a working product. We even managed to have time for a few hours of sleep before the presentations. When it was all said and done we had accomplished our goal: we won cheeseballs for best team name! All in all, we had an excellent time collaborating and developing a tool that will be used for a long time to come. I&rsquo;m already thinking about what to work on next ShipIt&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>ShipIt continues to be a great way for associates to work on something they haven’t had a chance to work on, build relationships within different organizations, and most importantly, enjoy themselves. ShipIt Day IX was a great success. The projects were creative and have potential to be built upon and used in Cerner’s everyday work flow. We are already looking forward to our next ShipIt Day in December!</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-dcos-with-spinnaker/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-dcos-with-spinnaker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last fall our team (<a href="https://github.com/mtweten">Mike Tweten</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TrevinTeacutter">Trevin Teacutter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/zsura">Zameer Sura</a>) started working on the problem of automating <a href="https://mesosphere.com/product/">DC/OS</a> deployments in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t require multiple teams to duplicate effort and tie themselves directly to DC/OS APIs.  While DC/OS certainly makes the act of deploying an application much easier than anything we&rsquo;ve used previously, there are still many different ways you could choose to layer on deployment strategies and integrate with continuous delivery systems. Additionally, there may be lots of teams with very similar needs in this space and there are certainly more efficient uses of their time than making them all solve the same problems.  Furthermore, while DC/OS is a good choice today we need to make sure that we don’t become locked in and can change our mind in the future without a big impact to those teams.</p>

<p>Being an engineering team, naturally our first approach was to try to write a service to manage a simple set of deployment strategies with an API that we could reimplement over other resource schedulers (like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>) in the future.  However, after producing a prototype we really started to grasp that we were taking on a much bigger task than we should.  Our API could handle some basic pre-built deployment workflows, but if it wasn&rsquo;t flexible enough for teams we&rsquo;d need to continue to adapt it.  In addition, we would still have to work out how it would integrate with CI/CD tools like <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, and we&rsquo;d have to do a lot of that work again each time we wanted to support another resource scheduler as a deployment target.</p>

<p>At this point we decided to take a deeper look at <a href="https://www.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker</a>, a continuous delivery platform that was open-sourced by Netflix.  It had originally been developed to orchestrate AWS deployments and had expanded to other providers like Azure, OpenStack, and more recently Kubernetes was added as the first container based deployment target.
Spinnaker allows for building deployment pipelines that can be triggered by things like Github commits or Jenkins builds and can then run stages to do things like start other Jenkins jobs, deploy new versions of an application, scale up or down applications, and disable old application versions.  With these capabilities we would be able to use Spinnaker to provide a consistent deployment abstraction while still providing the flexibility to handle deployment workflows that we didn&rsquo;t build ourselves.</p>

<p>The only minor problem was that it didn&rsquo;t support DC/OS, our preferred deployment target. After taking some time to dive in and get familiar with the details it quickly became apparent that adding support for DC/OS would be much easier than continuing to build our own system, especially since we had already become familiar with the DC/OS APIs while developing our prototype.  Not only would we then gain the flexibility to allow more deployment strategies than we originally anticipated, but it would also buy us integration with Jenkins and the ability to convert pipelines over to Kubernetes without much effort.  We checked with the Spinnaker community to make sure that no one was already working on DC/OS support and also with <a href="https://mesosphere.com/">Mesosphere</a> (the company behind DC/OS) to make sure they weren&rsquo;t planning to do it.  When both of those came back negative we began working on the project in earnest, with the goal of building something that would benefit not only Cerner but also the entire Spinnaker and DC/OS communities.</p>

<p>This was the first time that any of us had tried to contribute significant changes to an established open-source project so there was some adjustment and learning along the way.  We initially created our fork of the necessary repositories to our internal Github with the plan to finish the project before making anything visible publicly. Instead, we found that we wanted to more easily be able to share things with Mesosphere since they had agreed to give us any guidance we might need.  It also became apparent that it was too easy to commit things like config that referenced internal resources, or comments that referred to our own <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> issues.  If we kept going that way we were only going to make more work for ourselves cleaning those things up when it came time to submit our changes.  By moving our development to repos in <a href="https://github.com/cerner">Cerner&rsquo;s Github organization</a> we were able to solve both of these problems at once.</p>

<p>In spite of moving our code into the public Github we still maintained an insular development approach, determined to get everything just right before submitting a perfect polished gem to the upstream project.  In hindsight, we should have been less concerned about trying to get everything right all at once and submitted more incremental changes.  We thought it would be easier for everyone not to have to deal with our messy work in progress, but after our first pull request for one of the services ended up with over 130 files and a history of 100+ commits we realized that it&rsquo;s too much to expect the maintainers to review so much at once, especially when they may not be that familiar with DC/OS.  Ultimately, they wanted us to carve up that massive patch anyway so it would have been less work for us to do it from the start.</p>

<p>After completing this effort we&rsquo;ve found that we get even more benefit from Spinnaker than we initially expected.  Spinnaker also helps us manage deployments to multiple DC/OS clusters, use <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey">Chaos Monkey</a> to test the resiliency of our applications, and even to deploy DC/OS itself on AWS. We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that our contribution has been accepted by the Spinnaker maintainers and is now <a href="https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-3-0-changelog">available for anyone to use</a>.  The Spinnaker community has been great to work with and helped us by answering questions and inviting us to participate in the discussions with other companies that have contributed major functionality to Spinnaker.  This is an exciting opportunity to contribute something back to the open-source community and we can&rsquo;t wait to see where it goes from here.</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/structure-matters-how-cerner-handled-too-much-health-data-in-hbase/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/structure-matters-how-cerner-handled-too-much-health-data-in-hbase</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In order to manage the health of populations, Cerner builds data-driven solutions built on top of its <em>HealtheIntent</em>&#8480; platform. The platform transforms and standardizes data across disparate health systems. The data is then used in algorithms that aid healthcare providers and hospitals in managing and monitoring health both at a person and population level.</p>

<p>The Reference Record is one of the core components of the HealtheIntent platform. It represents the data known about a person&rsquo;s health from a particular source of healthcare information. Downstream components in the platform aggregate information across multiple reference records to understand the full picture of a person&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>To create the record, the system performs both batch and stream processing. Some sources send the data to HealtheIntent once a day or once a month. That data is processed in batch, using Hadoop MapReduce jobs. For sources that send the data as streams of updates in near real time, we rely on a homegrown near real time framework that sits on top of Apache Storm. Both the pipelines persist their processed data in HBase tables.</p>

<p>For the data processed in batch, we write all the data about the person from a given source to the HBase table as one HBase row. We refer to this as a wide table. The HBase Rowkey is the source identifier followed by the person identifier: <code>/source:&lt;id&gt;/person:&lt;id&gt;</code>. Each row could have multiple columns, one per each healthcare entity like allergy, medication, procedure, etc. Another thing to note is this table is salted for better distribution of data across regions. That means a given person&rsquo;s data will be in a single region since it&rsquo;s all in one row, but the data for a given source will be distributed across the HBase cluster.</p>

<p>For streaming sources, we use a different table approach. We have a tall table, where each healthcare entity is written separately. The Rowkey in this approach would be built from the source identifier, person identifier, entity type, and then individual entity identifier. This allows the system to manage the information flowing from the stream more efficiently.</p>

<p>To make sure that the consumers of the record don&rsquo;t have to know whether the data is coming from a streaming or batch source system, we offer a Crunch-based extract API that is capable of reading from either table structure. The API provides a single, consistent representation of the data.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to discuss what happened when a single person in our system received a little too much healthcare over the course of her fake life.</p>

<h3>The Investigation</h3>

<p>We were bringing a new source of healthcare data onto the HealtheIntent platform using our batch processing pipeline. In the midst of this work, a small number of MapReduce jobs started failing. Our failure monitoring triggered and notified us that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>

<p>We turned to the logs to investigate the failures. We saw this (not very informative) message:</p>

<blockquote><p>Task attempt_xxxx failed to report status for 601 seconds. Killing!</p></blockquote>

<p>Our first assumption was that the issue was related to memory, but we profiled the job and found that the heap utilization looked fine.</p>

<p>Querying across all the logs, we were able to see two key pieces of information. One, a job was more likely to fail if it was reading from a particular source of data, and two, failures were correlated with alerts on slow response times in HBase. Drilling deeper into our logs, we were able to find that sure enough, we were timing out trying to read from a particular region in HBase.</p>

<p>The next obvious step was to look at region metrics. We found the region had grown in size to 115 GB on a cluster configured to have a max region size of 10 GB. More logs showed the table had stopped compacting and splits weren&rsquo;t working due to a 30 GB row in the table.</p>

<p>At this time, anything trying to read that row was failing, but some large writes were still succeeding. There would be attempts to bulk load new data to the region, but the loads would invariably fail due to the large row. When the job ran again, it would attempt to write the same data, over and over. Occasionally during these attempts, some of the data would get written to the region. This process piled more and more data onto the region, and the region wouldn&rsquo;t split.</p>

<p>As the region was growing, the situation got worse. As previously mentioned, we salt the row keys to distribute data across the cluster. Jobs interested in other source data were also reading from this region, so we started seeing failures in other jobs. Then in the midst of our investigation, we saw more HBase region servers start failing. Then HBase bulk loads in other MapReduce jobs were also failing. We knew we had to get rid of the row and split the region.</p>

<p>As some team members worked on a plan to deal with the row, others moved on to answering the question, &ldquo;How did this one row get so big that the bulk loads started failing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With healthcare data, it&rsquo;s possible to imagine diseases that might lead someone to have so many encounters and activity within a single healthcare system that we could get to a gigabyte of health data about a person. However, we had never seen anything near this large before. It was a pretty significant outlier.</p>

<h3>Getting Rid of the Alternative Fact</h3>

<p>We decided to delete the person&rsquo;s data. However, the person had grown so large, this proved difficult. (The naive approach to deleting a row in HBase failed spectacularly.) Splitting was also not possible.</p>

<p>We needed a better plan. First, all reads and writes to the region had to stopped. This meant suspending all jobs that any potential to read or write. Since several teams depended on our data for their processing, we started by notifying all our downstream consumers. Then we stopped all reads and writes to the affected region. We copied the affected Hfiles to a new table. This allowed compaction (and as a result, deletion) to succeed. Cleaning up this one bad record brought the region size down to 2 GB from 200 GB. As part of this process, the table was disabled and the compacted Hfiles from the fixed region were copied back to the old table before it was re-enabled.</p>

<h3>Damage</h3>

<p>When we stopped all the jobs loading into that table, we had a stale data period for downstream processing. Reports that needed the data showed old information during the length of the incident investigation and mitigation. The good news is that our near real-time algorithms such as our Sepsis alerts and readmissions risk assessments were built on top of the stream processing system which was not impacted by this incident.</p>

<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>In our postmortem for the incident, we reviewed what we could have done better before, during, and immediately following the situation. A quick win for us was to add HBase region size monitoring &amp; alerting. It is still reactive, but would help us react faster and minimize the duration of the event.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the root of the problem is that we have an approach that encourages a lot of data to accumulate in a single row. We had a design flaw. While this patient was outside the realm of anything we&rsquo;d seen before, it wasn&rsquo;t outside the realm of possibility. To quote an oldie, but goodie from Frederick Brooks, &ldquo;Our first response should be to reorganize the modules&#8217; data structures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This event made us realize our batch and streaming representations of the data need to converge. That is the path we&rsquo;re now taking which will introduce its own set of challenges, but we&rsquo;re confident this will land us in a more stable, scalable place.</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/managing-splunk-knowledge/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/managing-splunk-knowledge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we first were given access to <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> we were excited about all the functionality it could provide our team to help us monitor and debug our applications. We created alerts to email us if our applications are logging errors, dashboards to show health or metrics of our services, and field extractions as well as tags to make searching easier. As we created more and more of these Splunk knowledge objects we started to have issues. For regulatory and validation concerns, we have several Splunk instances that represent different environments. This required us to copy and paste or duplicate the Splunk knowledge object we created in one environment to all the others. This became very tedious and we saw all sorts of problems. Objects were only copied to some Splunk instances, updates were sometimes lost, and permissions weren&rsquo;t consistent or someone would forget to make their object publically viewable. We set out to look for a solution.</p>

<p>After we couldn&rsquo;t find anything that could easily help us we created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/cerner/splunk-pickaxe">splunk-pickaxe</a>. splunk-pickaxe is a Ruby gem that provides a command-line interface for synchronizing a directory or repository of Splunk knowledge objects written as files to a Splunk instance. So now when a developer creates a new Splunk object, they would create and test it in our Splunk dev instance and then open a pull request to our Splunk Github repository with the object&rsquo;s configuration or contents . Other developers review the changes before it gets merged and automatically pushed out to all our Splunk instances using our splunk-pickaxe tool and <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> our continuous integration engine. This simplified things and provided consistency on these Splunk changes. We were also able to more effectively review the Splunk objects for efficient and proper Splunk usage.</p>

<p>The tool grew in popularity at Cerner and currently supports many Splunk objects:</p>

    <link href="http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/you-may-not-be-a-polyglot-but-your-code-needs-to-be/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://engineering.cerner.com/blog/you-may-not-be-a-polyglot-but-your-code-needs-to-be</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last October, I had the privilege to speak at <a href="https://ghc.anitaborg.org/">Grace Hopper</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest gathering of women technologists. It was impressive to see 15,000 fellow female technologists gather together to share their experiences and technical expertise. To look into the audience, and see a room full of other female engineers was a great experience!</p>

<p>My talk was titled, You May Not Be a Polyglot, but Your Code Needs to Be (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923ac4CSqsw">previously presented at Midwest.io</a>).
One definition of the term polyglot is &ldquo;composed in many languages.&rdquo; During my talk, I discussed common misconceptions about writing code for global audiences, and I provided tips to help position engineers for success in these types of projects.</p>

<p>Having worked in engineering, translation, and localization for more than over a decade, I have seen first-hand how projects struggle through the globalization process. A properly globalized solution is generally achieved by ensuring the appropriate internationalization, localization, and translation steps have taken place; however, as developers, we have misconceptions that make this process more costly and less effective than it needs to be.</p>

<p>To help set the stage, I began my talk by speaking in Spanish. I love watching the audience react to my comments, as I usually say something silly during the introduction, so those who understand react one way, while others in the audience tend to look puzzled.</p>

<p>One of the most common misconceptions when coding for a global audience is the infamous statement: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll NEVER need to do this.&rdquo; The most common rationalization for this misconception is that in the U.S., we only speak English, however, one in five U.S. residents speaks a foreign language at home. This is a record 61.8 million residents who speak languages other than English. Of these residents, 25.1 million (41 percent) told the Census Bureau that they speak English less than very well. Additionally, data from 2013 shows that there are seven languages with at least one million speakers in the US. These languages were Spanish (38.4 million), Chinese (three million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), and Korean and Arabic (1.1 million each). By only serving one audience, we are ignoring many customers and consumers of our solutions.  Even in my adopted hometown of Kansas City, 6% of the population speaks Spanish as their primary language.</p>

<p>Another common misconception is that internationalization and  localization are the same. Here are some definitions according to the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3):</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>&ldquo;Internationalization is the design and development of a product, application, or document content that <strong>enables</strong> easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a &lsquo;locale&rsquo;).&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to think of their relationship more like this: <strong>i18N + L10N == G11N</strong></p>

<br />


<p>While the W3 notes, &ldquo;some people use other terms, such as globalization to refer to the same concept&rdquo; as internationalization,&ldquo; I see the appropriate execution of internationalization and localization together as providing a globalized solution.</p>

<p>Among examples of appropriately globalized solutions, TripAdvisor is one I like to highlight because it has a broad user base, and many of its users don&rsquo;t realize it is used by others around the world in their own language. The following Trip Advisor elements help provide a positive user experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexing dates to show in the appropriate locale</li>
<li>Removing content that is not available in the target language (newsletters are a good example)</li>
<li>Accurate currency conversion</li>
<li>Allowing for text expansion to avoid truncation</li>
<li>Flexing logos and the brand to ensure that it is appropriate for the locale</li>
</ul>


<p>Another common misconception when creating globalized applications is that once something has been internationalized and translated, it can be shipped. The best way to highlight the folly of this perception is to look at some marketing mishaps. Below are some of my favorite ones:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>A famous detergent from the Middle East, is white as snow, so it is called by the word for snow in Farsi. This doesn&rsquo;t work well when it is referenced in English-speaking countries. In Farsi, the word for snow is barf.</li>
<li>I also have a personal story. I come from a tropical country, and my native language is Spanish. When I first moved to the United States, I realized that I was not genetically engineered to be in the cold, dry weather of a Kansas City winter. My skin was itchy, and I desperately need some good hydrating lotion. My friends at school recommended something called Sarna. I was convinced they were trolling me because in Spanish, Sarna means <em>Scabies</em>.
I have endured more than a dozen Kansas City winters, and I still can&rsquo;t make myself use that lotion, because I can&rsquo;t get over the name.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation alone is not a solution. The translator must be proficient. In a previous position I was frequently asked how long it takes to learn a language. I was fighting the misconception that anyone who has taken two years of a language could translate. After failing to articulate why that was a misconception, I found a wonderful tool, thanks to the Foreign Language Institute and the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR), who created a scale that is a set of descriptions of abilities to communicate in a language. One important aspect of this scale is that it is accurate when the evaluations are done by native speakers. It was originally developed by the United States Foreign Service Institute (FSI), and is still widely known as the FSI scale. It consists of descriptions of five levels of language proficiency.</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 1: Elementary</li>
<li>Level 2: Limited Working</li>
<li>Level 3: Professional Working</li>
<li>Level 4: Full Professional</li>
<li>Level 5: Native or Bilingual</li>
</ul>


<p>Then the scale estimates how long it takes to achieve that level of proficiency when a student is immersed learning the language at least six hours a day and at least five days per week. It then breaks down the languages by groups based on their difficulty:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy&rdquo; languages are French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and Swahili:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 weeks (240 hours) to achieve level 1/1+</li>
<li>16 weeks (480 hours) to achieve level 2</li>
<li>24 weeks (720 hours) to achieve level 2+</li>
</ul>


<p>&ldquo;Hard&rdquo; languages are divided into the following groups.</p>

<ul>
<li>Group 2: Bulgarian, Burmese, Greek, Hindi, Persian, Urdu.</li>
<li>Group 3: Amharic, Cambodian, Czech, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Lao, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.</li>
<li>Group 4: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean)</li>
</ul>


<p>To learn these languages, you must spend the following time:</p>

<ul>
<li>12 weeks (360 hours) to achieve level 1/1+</li>
<li>24 weeks (720 hours) to achieve level 1+ /2</li>
<li>44+ weeks (1320+ hours) to achieve level 2/2+</li>
</ul>


<p>Taking a language for two years (usually college or high-school) is simply not enough to achieve the appropriate level of proficiency needed to translate. Even native speakers are not effective at translation. Becoming proficient in a language is very challenging, and cultural aspects are important as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, brain activation patterns identified by the University of Turku in Finland show extensive activation of the brain during non-native language use, specifically, the left dorsolateral frontal cortex, which is associated with lexical search, semantic processing and verbal working memory. Brain activation patterns were clearly modulated by direction of translation, with more extensive activation during translation into the non-native language, which is often considered to a be more demanding task. These are not the same patterns used when speaking a language, though, as different brain connections need to exist.</p>

<p>Machine translation has become more effective in the last few years, but only language experts should leverage it as part of their toolset. Translating something into a language you don&rsquo;t understand is a recipe for disaster. Simply go to an online translation tool, put in a phrase, convert it to another language, then convert it back.  Chances are, the original does not match the twice-translated phrase.</p>

<p>If you are relying on professional translators, another common misconception is that translation can simply happen overnight. The truth is it CAN happen, just NOT well. A professional translator can usually translate about 2000 words per-day. If they are doing localization testing as well, you have to budget about twice the time for the regression test plans to be completed, as words will iteratively need to be changed as context is understood within the software.</p>

<p>Now that I have covered the most common misconceptions with internationalization, localization, and translation, the next portion of this blog will focus on practical tips.</p>

<p>As a developer, it is imperative that you understand your global strategy and what outcome the business is trying to accomplish. You don&rsquo;t want to invest a lot of development time making sure you can handle Right-To-Left languages or those that are double-byte if your business isn&rsquo;t planning on going to those markets.</p>

<p>Creating appropriate partnerships with language providers is key to successfully globalizing software, as they can help handle many aspects of the globalization process from translation to localization. Speaking to companies who are already globalizing their software is a good way to find good providers.</p>

<p>If you have to use free online tools to translate something internally (where the quality doesn&rsquo;t need to be high), make sure you understand the licensing of the tool. Some free tools will own your content once you run it through their translation engine.</p>

<p>Including internationalization as part of your development process is a key aspect to globalization success. This means it should be included in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design, including user interface design (UX)</li>
<li>Estimates</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ul>


<p>Localization testing is a new step that should be included in your process, which requires language experts to be involved. From a development perspective, there are a lot of existing artifacts that can be leveraged in this process, such as regression and feature test plans. It is always helpful if those artifacts can be separated into those that have UI changes or not.</p>

<p>Localization testing will likely focus on language changes and impacts to the UI. A byproduct of localization testing is that other types of defects might surface. Having a good process so that bugs can be reported and tracked is key.</p>

<p>If you are just starting down the road of internationalization, be sure you don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel on how to do it. Programming languages usually have well-documented libraries that can be used. If you are already internationalizing and working with a localization team, make sure you are commenting your code to provide clarification to the translators. Below is an example of a popular localization tool:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="http://engineering.cerner.com/assets/2017-07-11-you-may-not-be-a-polyglot-but-your-code-needs-to-be/polyglot.png">
</div>


<p>Once you have incorporated all the steps for localization into your process, it is important to understand that your text changes will now have financial impact as they will affect translations. Translation memories are commonly used by translators, and any change to the source text will trigger a new translation to be required.</p>

<p>Translation companies typically charge per word. The average cost per word in 2012 Common Sense Advisory&rsquo;s 2012 survey of more than 3,700 suppliers in 114 countries, using 220 language pairs, found that the average per-word rate for translation for the 30 most commonly used languages on the web is around 13.4 cents. The more impactful implication to your process is that text changes will trigger your localization testing cycle as it will be important to verify the new translations are correct in context.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some quick principles that you should be able to apply regardless of what programming language you use.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t concatenate strings. Language order matters with translation. Instead of doing this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Do something like this:</p>

<p>Refraining from concatenating strings allows lthe localization professional to ensure that grammar is appropriately represented in the language. If you concatenate strings you will be forcing someone to say something like:</p>

<p>&ldquo;House Red&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Red House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking of names, be mindful how you use them in an application. Build appropriate abstraction and flexibility. Names can cause headaches in localization because first names aren&rsquo;t always first, people can have multiple last names, and middle names might not be there at all.</p>

<p>I have a personal story about this. When I went to file my marriage license, we had a very interesting conversation with the clerk. He asked me what was my middle name. When I said that I don&rsquo;t have a middle name, he said the system had it as a required field. I suggested that he enter a space&hellip;after about 15 tense seconds he confirmed it had worked. This was in early 2000, and I hope things have changed, but since government moves at the speed of snails, I doubt it has.</p>

<p>My final tip to better handle localization is to always use the FULL locale, that is, both language and country code to allow for maximum flexibility and to budget more time than what you believe you will need for your project. This last tip sounds very lame, but experience has taught me that chances are you won&rsquo;t do it. Engineers tend to be very optimistic on their estimates, and generally fail to allocate sufficient time.</p>

<p>ShipIt Day VIII was held on April 20 and 21st. Seventeen teams made up of internal associates had just 24 hours to create something innovative, usable, and value-adding. This quarter&rsquo;s ShipIt Day was held at our new <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2017/02/10/get-a-sneak-peek-inside-cerner-s-new-innovations.html">Innovations Campus</a> in the Link Conference Center. We were excited to get to utilize the space for this event. Another awesome addition to this quarter&rsquo;s ShipIt Day was our new game rooms. We hosted a Donkey Kong challenge and the winner (<a href="https://twitter.com/russ_starr">@russ_starr</a>) received a five-pound gummy bear!</p>

<p>After a long day of hard work, everyone was ready to eat extra big pizzas from Pizza 51. Eleven big pizza&rsquo;s and one hundred and ninety-six breadsticks were surprisingly enough to feed the hard working brains.</p>

<p>After dinner, it was back to work for the teams. Later on in the evening, we played movies including Rogue One and MST3K. Participants also battled for the top Donkey Kong score.</p>

<p>Friday, April 21st rolled around and by 9:00am the teams were getting antsy to present their projects. Since this was our first ShipIt Day at the new Innovations Campus, we were able to utilize the Assembly space.</p>

<p>ShipIt Day VIII brought to life some incredible projects. Team Freudian Ship, made up of Kate Young, Erin Dorpinghaus, Courtney Ground, Chris Farr and Sean Albery, took first place (and the golden keyboard!) with their project.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Intellectual Property (IP) Analytics team is tasked with managing a data warehouse. This includes ensuring that data updates take place in &ldquo;jobs.&rdquo; When a job fails it results in stale data and this can impact thousands of associates. This project took advantage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> by connecting tasks associated with managing the database to a voice command <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Alexa</a> skill which results in the ability to manage the database from anywhere the user has an internet connection. To put it in perspective, the database admin will now be able to ensure that the database is up to date without even getting out of bed in the morning. A simple voice command to an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Echo-Dot-Add-Alexa-To-Any-Room/dp/B01DFKC2SO">Amazon Echo Dot</a> (which each of us won as a prize) will result in the restarting of failed jobs and even logging JIRA tickets to begin the troubleshooting process if needed.</p></blockquote>

<p>ShipIt Judge Dan Stocksick was impressed with the project, &ldquo;Great use of consumer products into our ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Second place went to team Flowalva (Wuchen Wang and Dhruv Patel).</p>

<blockquote><p>Our ShipIt project was a traffic visualization system for web services supporting Millennium. In this project we used Splunk API to collect the data from services and visualize the traffic between nodes in using <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral">Netflix&rsquo;s vizceral project.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Jason Heiting was impressed. &ldquo;Very neat visualizations.  Intuitive UI for navigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last but not least, was third place winners, Flying Mongoose (Cihan Kaynak, Matt Stramel, Mahesh Acharya, Taylor Clay).</p>

<blockquote><p>We created a cross platform mobile app which can be used by a pharmacy technician while picking up and scanning medications at the pharmacy to refill <a href="https://www.cerner.com/solutions/automated-dispensing-cabinet">Cerner&rsquo;s RxStation</a> cabinets. Prior to this project, an RCP based desktop app was running in a PC mounted on a cart with an attached barcode scanner and label printer. This type of bulky setup was reducing the mobility of the technician.</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p>ShipIt continues to be a great way for associates to work on something they haven&rsquo;t had a chance to work on, build relationships within different organizations and most importantly, enjoy themselves. Ian Kottman, an engineer on the Population Health Genomics team, has participated in multiple ShipIt Days. The reason: &ldquo;I enjoy getting the time to create something that will make someone&rsquo;s life easier.&rdquo; Carlo Filipelli, system engineer, also agrees, adding on, &ldquo;ShipIt is great because it allows associates to work on interesting projects that they might not be able to get to during normal work hours. It fosters innovation and new ideas that would typically get overlooked in our busy day to day jobs. It is also a conducive environment for learning, collaboration, and having some fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you to all our participants and a special thank you to judges Jason Heiting, Justin Morrison, Dwight Sloan and Dan Stocksick.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars: ShipIt Day IX will be held in July 2017. If you are interested in learning more about other ShipIt Days, see these earlier posts:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cuando no están trabajando, Denisse Osorio de Large, Directora de Cerner en Desarrollo de Salud Poblacional y Steven Large, Director sénior de Desarrollo de IP, quienes están casados, tienen como pasión crear una generación joven motivada por la tecnología y mostrarle a la misma el amplio mundo de oportunidades existentes en el desarrollo de software. Además de dar su tiempo como voluntarios en la comunidad promotora del área de ciencias, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas (STEM), contribuyen a organizar la conferencia de desarrollo de Cerner (DevCon) y realizan presentaciones en conferencias, Denisse y Steven disfrutan trabajar con niños de la comunidad de habla hispana.</p>

<p>El año pasado, Denisse, originaria de Colombia y cuya lengua materna es el español, y Steven, quién habla español, organizaron dos eventos de codificación ofrecidos específicamente a familias de habla hispana en colaboración con la agrupación <em>Girl Scouts</em>, niñas exploradoras. Los objetivos de estos eventos de &ldquo;Pastelitos y Programación&rdquo;, <em>Coding and Cupcakes</em>, consistieron en ofrecer un entorno seguro e incluyente para que las chicas llevaran a cabo actividades de programación, desarrollaran capacidades de liderazgo y un gusto por la resolución de problemas mediante la codificación. Las jóvenes disfrutaron la satisfacción que brinda resolver los desafíos de codificación de code.org y de juegos como Laberintos de <em>Angry Birds</em>. En el juego, usando conceptos de programación, las chicas se divirtieron al encontrar la forma de guiar a las aves que, atravesando un laberinto, debían llegar a los cerdos (ver video del evento a continuación).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Outside of work, married couple Denisse Osorio de Large, a Cerner Director in Population Health Development, and Steven Large, a Cerner Senior Director in IP Development, are passionate about creating a younger generation that is passionate about technology and introducing them to the vast world of opportunities in software development. In addition to volunteering in the STEM community, helping organize Cerner’s development conference (DevCon), and speaking at conferences, Denisse and Steven enjoy working with children in the spanish-speaking community.</p>

<p>Last year, Denisse (who is Colombian and a spanish-speaking native) and Steven (who is fluent in spanish) hosted two coding events specifically catered to spanish speaking families in partnership with Girl Scouts. The goals of these events, “Pastelitos y Programación” (“Coding and Cupcakes”), were to provide a safe and inclusive environment for girls to program, grow leadership abilities, and love solving problems with code. Girls enjoyed completing coding challenges from code.org and playing Labyrinths for Angry Birds. In the game, the girls had fun figuring out how to guide birds through a labyrinth to the pigs (see more about the event in the video below) using programming concepts.</p>

</div>


<p>In recognition of their passion for developing future innovators in STEM, Girl Scouts honored Denisse and Steven Large for their work in hosting the Pastelitos y Programación (Coding and Cupcakes) at Cerner. The Girl Scouts Innovator Award recognizes volunteers who saw a problem and developed an innovative solution to further Girl Scouting. These family events help bridge the communication gap between parents and girls when it comes to participating in Girl Scout events. With their passion and dedication for volunteering in the community, Denisse and Steven are encouraging more girls to become involved with STEM activities. Congratulations, Denisse and Steven!</p>
